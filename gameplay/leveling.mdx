# Leveling System

Soldiers gain XP through training and combat. Higher levels mean stronger soldiers.

## XP Requirements

| Level | Total XP Needed | XP to Next Level |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| 1     | 0               | 500              |
| 2     | 500             | 1,000            |
| 3     | 1,500           | 1,500            |
| 4     | 3,000           | 2,000            |
| 5     | 5,000           | 2,500            |
| 6     | 7,500           | 3,000            |
| 7     | 10,500          | 3,500            |
| 8     | 14,000          | 4,000            |
| 9     | 18,000          | 4,500            |
| 10    | 22,500          | —                |

<Note>
  Level 10 is currently the maximum level.

## XP Sources

### Training (Primary Source)

| Method                             | XP per Session |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Active Training (Marksman + Elite) | ~125 XP        |
| Active Training (average)          | ~80-100 XP     |
| Passive Training (24h)             | 40 XP          |

Training is the most reliable way to level soldiers. Active training with good performance is the fastest path.

### Combat XP

| Outcome            | XP Earned |
| ------------------ | --------- |
| Battle Victory     | 25 XP     |
| Battle Defeat      | 2 XP      |
| Successful Defense | 5 XP      |

Combat XP is smaller but adds up over many battles.

### Power from XP

Your soldier's power includes an XP bonus:

```
XP Power Bonus = Total XP ÷ 100
```

**Example:** A soldier with 5,000 XP (Level 5) gets +50 power from XP.

## Leveling Strategy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Fastest leveling">
    1. Use Active Training on Elite difficulty
    2. Aim for 85%+ accuracy (Marksman grade)
    3. Train in batches (one drill benefits all soldiers)
    4. Use instant complete if you want to train again same day
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Passive leveling">
    1. Start 24h passive training before bed
    2. Collect 40 XP per soldier next day
    3. Slower but zero effort
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Combat leveling">
    1. Fight battles for incremental XP
    2. Victories give 25 XP
    3. Even defeats give 2 XP
    4. Good supplement to training
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Time to Max Level

Rough estimates assuming daily play:

| Method                  | Time to Level 10 |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Active Training only    | ~2-3 months      |
| Passive Training only   | ~18 months       |
| Mixed (active + combat) | ~2 months        |

<Tip>
  Focus your active training on your best soldiers. Let others passively train overnight.
