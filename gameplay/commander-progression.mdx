# Commander Progression

Your Commander represents you — the strategist behind the army. As you play, your Commander gains experience, ranks up, and unlocks new capabilities.

## Daily Discipline Checks

Each day (UTC), you can complete 2 discipline checks:

| Check | How to Complete | Reward |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **Train** | Complete any training session | +1 CDP |
| **Engage** | Execute any PvP battle | +1 CDP |

**Max per day: 2 CDP**

<Tip>
Complete both checks in a single day for a **Perfect Day**. Chain perfect days together to build your **Streak**.
</Tip>

## Commander Discipline Points (CDP)

CDP is your permanent progression currency. It accumulates forever and never resets.

### What CDP Unlocks

As you level up, you unlock:

- **New gear types** for your soldiers
- **Additional facility slots** on territories
- **More territory slots** in your control
- **Special abilities** and features
- **Exclusive titles** and profile badges

<Note>
Your Commander Level never decreases. It represents your total dedication to the Cronos Army.
</Note>

## Streaks & Perfect Days

**Perfect Day:** Complete both discipline checks (Train + Engage) in a single UTC day.

**Streak:** Chain consecutive perfect days. Your current and longest streak are tracked on your profile.

## Weekly Performance Points (WPP)

While CDP is permanent, WPP measures your **weekly** activity and resets every Monday.

### Earning WPP

| Activity | WPP |
|----------|-----|
| Training (by duration) | 1–24 WPP |
| PvP Attack (start) | 5 WPP |
| PvP Attack (win) | +10 WPP |
| PvP Deploy (per hour) | 1 WPP |
| PvP Deploy (win) | +5 WPP |
| Territory Attack | 5 WPP |
| Territory Conquest | +20 WPP |
| Facility Build | 15 WPP |
| Facility Upgrade | 10 WPP × level |

### Leaderboard Eligibility

<Warning>
You must complete at least **4 discipline checks** during the week to appear on the WPP leaderboard.
</Warning>

This means completing your daily checks on at least 2 different days (with at least 4 total checks across all days).

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I lose CDP or levels?">
    No. CDP and Commander Levels are permanent and never decrease.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I miss a day?">
    Your streak resets to 0, but your CDP and level remain unchanged. Start a new streak tomorrow.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to be on the leaderboard to earn CDP?">
    No. CDP is earned from discipline checks regardless of leaderboard eligibility.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the fastest way to rank up?">
    Complete both daily checks consistently. That's 14 CDP per week maximum. Active play (more PvP, training, conquest) doesn't directly increase CDP but helps with WPP.
