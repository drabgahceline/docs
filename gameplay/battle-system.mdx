# Battle System

Cronos Army features strategic turn-based combat where every decision matters.

## How Battles Work

When you enter a battle, your soldiers face the enemy team. Combat alternates until one side is eliminated.

### The Combat Loop

```
Your Turn → Select Soldier → Choose Action → Pick Target → Attack Executes → Enemy Turn → Repeat
```

## Your Turn

Each turn, you make three decisions:

### 1. Select Your Soldier

Choose which soldier acts this turn. Consider:
- **Health** — Protect wounded soldiers
- **Personality** — Match specials to the situation
- **Energy** — All soldiers in battle fight at full power

### 2. Choose Your Action

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Attack" icon="sword">
    **Full damage**, no protection. Best for finishing enemies.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Defensive" icon="shield">
    **Reduced damage** dealt and received. Good when low on health.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Special" icon="star">
    **Unique ability** based on personality. Can turn the tide.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 3. Pick Your Target

Select which enemy to attack. **Focus fire** — eliminating one enemy quickly is usually better than spreading damage.

## Personality Specials

Every soldier personality has a unique special ability:

| Personality | Special Move | Effect |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| **Aggressive** | Piercing Strike | Ignores 50% of enemy defense |
| **Intelligent** | Analyze Weakness | +40% damage to target |
| **Reckless** | All-In | 2x damage, take +50% damage next turn |
| **Defensive** | Shield Wall | -60% damage taken this turn |
| **Funny** | Distract | Enemy has 30% miss chance |
| **Mysterious** | Shadow Step | 40% dodge chance next attack |
| **Inspiring** | Rally | Heal all allies 15% |
| **Stubborn** | Last Stand | Can't die this turn (min 1 HP) |

<Tip>
Learn when to use each special. A well-timed Shield Wall or Rally can save a losing battle.
</Tip>

## Enemy AI Behavior

When defending, enemy soldiers respond based on their personalities:

- **Aggressive** defenders hunt your weakest soldier
- **Stubborn** defenders attack whoever hit them last
- **Intelligent** defenders focus your biggest threat
- **Defensive** defenders protect their wounded allies

Understanding these patterns helps you predict enemy moves.

## Winning Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Focus Fire">
    Concentrate attacks on one enemy. A dead enemy deals zero damage. Spreading damage lets everyone keep attacking you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Protect Your Wounded">
    Switch hurt soldiers to Defensive stance. Use Inspiring soldiers to Rally heal. Don't let enemies pick off your weak links.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Time Your Specials">
    Don't spam specials randomly. Save Piercing Strike for high-defense enemies. Use Shield Wall when you're about to take a big hit.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Read the Enemy">
    Watch enemy personalities. If they're all Aggressive, they'll swarm your weakest soldier — protect them or sacrifice them strategically.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Card Battles (Siege Combat)

When attacking or defending territories, combat uses the **card battle** system — a tactical showdown between soldier cards.

### Card Battle Overview

Each soldier becomes a **battle card** with:
- **Health** — How much damage they can take
- **Attack** — Base damage dealt
- **Personality** — Determines their special ability
- **Special Move** — One-time powerful ability (once per battle)

### Siege Card Combat

Territory sieges use card battles:

1. **Attacker deploys** up to 3 soldier cards
2. **Defender's cards** are already assigned to the territory
3. **Turn-based combat** — each side picks actions
4. **Last team standing wins**

### Card Actions

Each turn, pick an action for your active soldier:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Attack" icon="sword">
    Deal **full damage** to target. No protection.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Defensive" icon="shield">
    Deal **50% damage**, take **50% less** damage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Special" icon="star">
    Unleash your **personality ability**. One use per battle.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Personality Special Moves

Each personality has a unique game-changing ability:

| Personality | Special Name | Effect |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| **Aggressive** | Relentless Assault | 2x damage, ignores all defense |
| **Relaxed** | Second Wind | Heal 50% HP, immune to damage this round |
| **Intelligent** | Exploit Weakness | 3x damage to lowest HP enemy |
| **Mysterious** | Mind Control | Target attacks their own ally |
| **Stubborn** | 💎 HODL | Reflect 50% damage back to attacker |
| **Funny** | Wild Card | Random: heal all 50% OR 2x damage to all OR swap HP |
| **Inspiring** | Rally Cry | Heal all allies 30%, boost their next attack |
| **Reckless** | Blaze of Glory | Massive damage, but take 50% recoil |
| **Zombie** | Undying | Survive fatal blow with 1 HP (once) |

<Warning>
Specials can only be used **once per battle**. Time them carefully — a wasted special can cost you the fight.
</Warning>

### Progressive Siege

Territory sieges are **progressive** — damage carries over:

1. **Each battle chips away** at defender/attacker health
2. **Multiple attacks** may be needed to capture
3. **Defenders can reinforce** between attacks
4. **Territory falls** when all defenders are eliminated

This creates strategic depth — do you go all-in or wear them down over time?
