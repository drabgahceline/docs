# Battle System

Cronos Army uses a **3v3 turn-based card battle** system. You pick 3 soldiers, the enemy has 3 soldiers, and you fight until one team is eliminated.

## How It Works

1. **Select 3 soldiers** from your army
2. **Take turns** — you act, then one enemy responds
3. **Choose actions** — Attack, Defensive, or Special
4. **Last team standing wins**

Each soldier has:
- **Power** — Determines damage dealt
- **HP** — Based on energy (0-100)
- **Personality** — Determines their special ability

## Actions

Each turn, pick one action for your active soldier:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Attack" icon="sword">
    **Full damage** to target. No protection.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Defensive" icon="shield">
    **50% damage** dealt, **50% less** damage taken.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Special" icon="star">
    **Unique ability** based on personality. One use per battle.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
Your team only gets **ONE special** per battle — across all soldiers. Use it wisely.
</Warning>

## Personality Specials

Every personality has a unique special ability. These can turn the tide of battle:

| Personality | Special Name | Effect |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| **Aggressive** | Relentless Assault | 2x damage, ignores all defense |
| **Relaxed** | Second Wind | Heal 50% HP, immune to damage this round |
| **Intelligent** | Exploit Weakness | 3x damage to lowest HP enemy |
| **Mysterious** | Mind Control | Target attacks their own ally |
| **Stubborn** | 💎 HODL | Reflect 50% damage back to attacker this round |
| **Funny** | Wild Card | Random: heal all 50% OR 2x damage to all OR swap HP |
| **Inspiring** | Rally Cry | All allies heal 30%, +50% damage next turn |
| **Reckless** | APE IN | 4x damage, but lose 75% of your HP |
| **Zombie** | Brain Feast | 1.5x damage. If this kills, heal 50% HP |

<Tip>
Build your team around complementary specials. An **Inspiring** soldier can set up a devastating **Aggressive** or **Intelligent** follow-up.
</Tip>

## Damage Calculation

Damage is based on the **power ratio** between attacker and defender:

- **Base damage** = Attacker's power ÷ 10
- **Power ratio modifier** = Attacker power ÷ Defender power (capped 0.5x to 1.5x)
- **Stronger soldiers** deal more damage AND take less

### Example

A soldier with 200 power attacking one with 100 power:
- Base: 200 ÷ 10 = 20 damage
- Ratio: 200 ÷ 100 = 2.0 → capped to 1.5x
- Final: 20 × 1.5 = **30 damage**

## Battle Events

Random events can modify damage during attacks:

| Event | Chance | Effect |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Solid Hit | Common | +25% damage |
| Critical Strike | Uncommon | +50% damage |
| Devastating Blow | Rare | +100% damage |
| Glancing Blow | Common | -25% damage |
| Fumble | Uncommon | -50% damage |
| Complete Whiff | Rare | -80% damage |

<Note>
**Funny** soldiers have double the chance for battle events. High variance, high entertainment.
</Note>

## Enemy AI Targeting

When defending, enemy soldiers pick targets based on personality:

| Personality | Targeting Logic |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Aggressive** | Attacks your lowest HP soldier |
| **Intelligent** | Attacks your highest power soldier |
| **Stubborn** | Counter-attacks whoever hit them |
| **Zombie** | Targets lowest HP (going for kills) |
| **Others** | Random or first available |

Understanding AI patterns helps you predict enemy moves and protect vulnerable soldiers.

## Winning Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Focus Fire">
    Concentrate attacks on one enemy. A dead soldier deals zero damage. Spreading damage lets everyone keep hitting you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Protect Your Wounded">
    Switch hurt soldiers to Defensive stance. Use Inspiring's Rally Cry to heal. Don't let enemies pick off weak links.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Time Your Special">
    You only get ONE. Don't waste it early. Save it for when it matters — a clutch heal, a finishing blow, or turning a losing fight.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Build Synergies">
    Team composition matters. Inspiring + Aggressive is a classic combo. Stubborn can bait attacks while others deal damage.
