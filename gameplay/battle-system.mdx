# Battle System

Cronos Army features strategic turn-based combat where every decision matters.

## How Battles Work

When you enter a battle, your soldiers face the enemy team. Combat alternates until one side is eliminated.

### The Combat Loop

```
Your Turn → Select Soldier → Choose Action → Pick Target → Attack Executes → Enemy Turn → Repeat
```

## Your Turn

Each turn, you make three decisions:

### 1. Select Your Soldier

Choose which soldier acts this turn. Consider:
- **Health** — Protect wounded soldiers
- **Personality** — Match specials to the situation
- **Energy** — All soldiers in battle fight at full power

### 2. Choose Your Action

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Attack" icon="sword">
    **Full damage**, no protection. Best for finishing enemies.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Defensive" icon="shield">
    **Reduced damage** dealt and received. Good when low on health.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Special" icon="star">
    **Unique ability** based on personality. Can turn the tide.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 3. Pick Your Target

Select which enemy to attack. **Focus fire** — eliminating one enemy quickly is usually better than spreading damage.

## Personality Specials

Every soldier personality has a unique special ability:

| Personality | Special Move | Effect |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| **Aggressive** | Piercing Strike | Ignores 50% of enemy defense |
| **Intelligent** | Analyze Weakness | +40% damage to target |
| **Reckless** | All-In | 2x damage, take +50% damage next turn |
| **Defensive** | Shield Wall | -60% damage taken this turn |
| **Funny** | Distract | Enemy has 30% miss chance |
| **Mysterious** | Shadow Step | 40% dodge chance next attack |
| **Inspiring** | Rally | Heal all allies 15% |
| **Stubborn** | Last Stand | Can't die this turn (min 1 HP) |

<Tip>
Learn when to use each special. A well-timed Shield Wall or Rally can save a losing battle.
</Tip>

## Enemy AI Behavior

When defending, enemy soldiers respond based on their personalities:

- **Aggressive** defenders hunt your weakest soldier
- **Stubborn** defenders attack whoever hit them last
- **Intelligent** defenders focus your biggest threat
- **Defensive** defenders protect their wounded allies

Understanding these patterns helps you predict enemy moves.

## Winning Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Focus Fire">
    Concentrate attacks on one enemy. A dead enemy deals zero damage. Spreading damage lets everyone keep attacking you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Protect Your Wounded">
    Switch hurt soldiers to Defensive stance. Use Inspiring soldiers to Rally heal. Don't let enemies pick off your weak links.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Time Your Specials">
    Don't spam specials randomly. Save Piercing Strike for high-defense enemies. Use Shield Wall when you're about to take a big hit.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Read the Enemy">
    Watch enemy personalities. If they're all Aggressive, they'll swarm your weakest soldier — protect them or sacrifice them strategically.
  </Accordion>
