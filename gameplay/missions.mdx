# Missions

Missions are PvE (Player vs Environment) challenges where your soldiers tackle objectives, fight AI enemies, and earn rewards. Unlike PvP battles, missions let you progress at your own pace.

## What Are Missions?

Missions are structured challenges with clear objectives. Send your soldiers, complete the goal, and collect your rewards.

## Mission Types

Different missions test different aspects of your army:

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Combat** | Defeat waves of enemies | Testing soldier combat builds |
| **Patrol** | Secure territory zones | Earning steady rewards |
| **Raid** | Hit a target and extract | High-risk, high-reward runs |
| **Defense** | Hold position against attacks | Defensive soldier builds |

<Tip>
Match your soldier's personality and stats to mission types. A defensive personality excels in Defense missions.
</Tip>

## Difficulty Levels

Each mission has difficulty tiers affecting rewards and challenge:

| Difficulty | Enemy Strength | Reward Multiplier |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Easy** | Weak | 1x |
| **Normal** | Moderate | 1.5x |
| **Hard** | Strong | 2x |
| **Veteran** | Very Strong | 3x |

<Warning>
Higher difficulties require stronger soldiers. Don't send a Level 2 soldier into Veteran content.
</Warning>

### Recommended Soldier Level

| Difficulty | Min Level | Recommended |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Easy | 1 | 1-3 |
| Normal | 3 | 4-6 |
| Hard | 5 | 7-10 |
| Veteran | 8 | 12+ |

## Mission Rewards

Complete missions to earn:

### Credits
In-game currency for upgrades, energy recovery, and more. Higher difficulty = more credits.

### XP
Your deployed soldiers gain experience. Missions are a solid way to level up alongside training.

### Gear Drops
Chance to find equipment for your soldiers. Harder missions have better drop rates.

| Difficulty | Gear Drop Chance | Rarity Potential |
|------------|------------------|------------------|
| Easy | 5% | Common |
| Normal | 10% | Common, Uncommon |
| Hard | 15% | Common, Uncommon, Rare |
| Veteran | 25% | All rarities |

---

## Energy Cost

Missions consume soldier energy like battles:

| Difficulty | Energy Cost |
|------------|-------------|
| Easy | 15 |
| Normal | 25 |
| Hard | 40 |
| Veteran | 60 |

<Note>
Soldiers need at least 20% energy to deploy. Plan your roster — don't burn all your best soldiers on one mission chain.
</Note>

## Starting a Mission

1. **Open the Missions panel** from Command Center
2. **Select a mission** — check difficulty and rewards
3. **Choose your soldiers** — assign 1-3 soldiers based on mission requirements
4. **Deploy** — mission runs automatically
5. **Collect rewards** — success or failure, you get the results

### Soldier Selection

Some missions require specific soldier counts:

| Mission Size | Soldiers Required |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Solo | 1 |
| Squad | 2-3 |
| Platoon | 4-5 |

<Tip>
Balance your team. A mix of offensive and defensive personalities often outperforms min-maxed squads.
</Tip>

## Mission vs Training vs Battle

Confused about where to spend your energy? Here's the breakdown:

| Activity | Purpose | Time | Player Effort |
|----------|---------|------|---------------|
| **Missions** | PvE rewards + XP | Variable | Low (auto-complete) |
| **Training** | XP focus + gear | 1 min / 24h | Active or passive |
| **Battle** | PvP competition + territory | Minutes | Active decisions |

**Use missions when:** You want guaranteed rewards without PvP stress.

**Use training when:** You specifically want to level a soldier.

**Use battles when:** You're ready to compete for territory and WPP.
