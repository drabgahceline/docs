# Training System

Training is how your soldiers gain XP and level up. Choose between hands-on action or set-and-forget progression.

## Two Ways to Train

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Active Training" icon="crosshairs">
    Play a shooting drill mini-game. Better performance = more XP.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Passive Training" icon="moon">
    AFK training over 24 hours. Half the XP, but zero effort required.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Active Training

Jump into a target practice drill and earn rewards based on your performance.

### How It Works

1. **Select soldiers** to train (batch training supported)
2. **Pay energy cost** (15 energy per soldier)
3. **Play the drill** — shoot targets for 60 seconds
4. **Get graded** — your accuracy determines XP multiplier
5. **All selected soldiers** receive the same grade bonus

### The Shooting Drill

You have 60 seconds to hit as many targets as possible:

- **Standard targets** — normal points
- **Small targets** — harder to hit, more points
- **Headshots** — 2x points on any target

<Tip>
Focus on accuracy over speed. Higher accuracy = higher grade = more XP for ALL your training soldiers.
</Tip>

### Grades & XP Multipliers

Your accuracy determines your grade:

| Grade | Accuracy | XP Multiplier | Example XP |
|-------|----------|---------------|------------|
| **Marksman** | 85%+ | 1.35x | ~108 XP |
| **Sharpshooter** | 70-84% | 1.25x | ~100 XP |
| **Qualified** | 55-69% | 1.15x | ~92 XP |
| **Trained** | Below 55% | 1.0x | 80 XP |

*Base XP is 80. Final XP = Base × Grade Multiplier × Speed Multiplier*

### Difficulty Modes

Choose your challenge level:

| Mode | Target Speed | XP Multiplier | Best For |
|------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| **Recruit** | Slow | 0.7x | Learning the drill |
| **Soldier** | Normal | 1.0x | Balanced challenge |
| **Elite** | Fast | 1.16x | Maximum XP |

<Note>
**Difficulty DOES affect XP.** Elite mode is harder but rewards ~16% more XP than Soldier mode.
</Note>

### Maximum XP Calculation

Best case scenario (Elite + Marksman):
- Base: 80 XP
- Grade (Marksman): × 1.35
- Speed (Elite): × 1.16
- **Total: ~125 XP per soldier**

## Passive Training

Don't have time to play? Send your soldiers on a 24-hour training mission.

### How It Works

1. **Select soldiers** to train
2. **Pay energy cost** (15 energy per soldier)
3. **Soldiers unavailable** for 24 hours
4. **Collect rewards** when timer ends (or instant complete)

### Passive Rewards

| Reward | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| **XP** | 40 XP (50% of base) |
| **Gear** | Standard drop chance |

<Warning>
Soldiers in passive training cannot battle or defend territories until training completes.
</Warning>

## Training Comparison

| Aspect | Active | Passive |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Time** | ~60 seconds | 24 hours |
| **Effort** | Play mini-game | None |
| **Energy Cost** | 15 | 15 |
| **XP Range** | 80-125 | 40 |
| **Best XP** | ~125 (Elite + Marksman) | 40 |
| **Soldier availability** | Immediate | Locked 24h |

**Recommendation:** Active training is always better if you have 60 seconds to spare. Use passive only when you won't be playing for a full day.

## Instant Complete

Don't want to wait 24 hours? Pay **1 Credit** to instantly complete any training session.

- Flat cost regardless of time remaining
- Soldier receives full XP reward immediately
- Useful when you need soldiers ready NOW

---

## Batch Training

Train multiple soldiers at once:

1. Select up to 10 soldiers
2. Play ONE drill
3. ALL soldiers receive the same grade bonus
4. Each soldier pays 15 energy individually

<Tip>
Batch training is efficient — one good drill run benefits your entire squad.
</Tip>

## Facility Bonuses

- **Barracks** — Increases XP gained from training
- **Forge** — Increases gear drop chance

Check your territory facilities to see current bonuses.
