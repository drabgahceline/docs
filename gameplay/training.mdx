# Training System

Training is how your soldiers gain XP and level up. Choose between hands-on action or set-and-forget progression.

## Two Ways to Train

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Active Training" icon="crosshairs">
    Play a shooting drill mini-game. Better performance = more XP + gear drops.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Passive Training" icon="moon">
    AFK training over 24 hours. Less XP, but zero effort required.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Active Training

Jump into a target practice drill and earn rewards based on your performance.

### How It Works

1. **Select a soldier** to train
2. **Pay energy cost** (40 energy)
3. **Play the drill** — shoot targets for 60 seconds
4. **Get graded** — your accuracy determines rewards
5. **Collect XP + chance for gear**

### The Shooting Drill

You have 60 seconds to hit as many targets as possible:

- **Standard targets** — normal points
- **Small targets** — harder to hit, more points
- **Fast targets** — moving quickly, bonus points
- **Headshots** — 2x points on any target

<Tip>
Focus on accuracy over speed. A Perfect grade is worth significantly more than spraying and missing.
</Tip>

### Grades & Rewards

Your accuracy determines your grade:

| Grade | Accuracy | XP Multiplier | Gear Drop Chance |
|-------|----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Perfect** | 90%+ | 100% (540 XP) | 30% |
| **Great** | 75-89% | 80% (432 XP) | 10% |
| **Good** | 60-74% | 60% (324 XP) | 7% |
| **OK** | Below 60% | 40% (216 XP) | 5% |

### Difficulty Modes

Choose your challenge level:

| Mode | Target Speed | Best For |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Recruit** | Slow | Learning the drill |
| **Soldier** | Normal | Balanced challenge |
| **Elite** | Fast | Maximum bragging rights |

<Note>
Difficulty doesn't affect XP or gear drops — pick whatever's fun for you.
</Note>

## Passive Training

Don't have time to play? Send your soldier on a 24-hour training mission.

### How It Works

1. **Select a soldier** to train
2. **Pay energy cost** (40 energy)
3. **Soldier is unavailable** for 24 hours
4. **Collect rewards** when timer ends

### Passive Rewards

| Reward | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| **XP** | 30% of active max (162 XP) |
| **Gear** | No drop chance |

<Warning>
Soldiers in passive training cannot battle or be assigned to territories until training completes.
</Warning>

## Training Comparison

| Aspect | Active | Passive |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Time** | ~60 seconds | 24 hours |
| **Effort** | Play mini-game | None |
| **Max XP** | 540 | 162 |
| **Gear drops** | 5-30% chance | None |
| **Soldier availability** | Immediate | Locked 24h |

**Recommendation:** Active training is always better if you have 60 seconds to spare. Use passive only when you won't be playing for a full day.

## Energy Cost

Both training modes cost **40 energy** to start.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if I don't have enough energy?">
    Wait for passive regeneration or spend Credits for instant recovery.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I cancel training?">
    Active training can't be cancelled once started. Passive training... just wait it out.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do facilities affect training?">
    Yes! Upgraded facilities can boost XP gains and gear drop rates.
