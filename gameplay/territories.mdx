# Territories

Territories generate **passive CRO income** every hour. Capture them, hold them, and stake CA tokens to maximize earnings.

## How It Works

- Each territory generates CRO hourly while you control it
- Other players can attack your territories at any time
- You must defend or lose control (and the income)
- Maximum **5 territories** per wallet

## Territory Tiers

Territories come in three tiers with different earning rates:

| Tier | Base CRO/Hour | Availability |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| **Common** | ~0.065 CRO | Most common |
| **Rare** | ~0.21 CRO | Less common |
| **Epic** | ~1.49 CRO | Very rare |

<Note>
Epic territories earn 20x+ more than Common, but they're heavily contested.
</Note>

## Staking CA Tokens

Stake CA tokens on your territories to boost income:

| Stake Amount | Multiplier |
|--------------|------------|
| 1,000 - 4,999 CA | 1.0x (base) |
| 5,000 - 9,999 CA | 1.5x |
| 10,000 - 24,999 CA | 2.0x |
| 25,000 - 49,999 CA | 3.0x |
| 50,000+ CA | 4.0x |

**Example:** An Epic territory with 50k CA staked:
- Base: 1.49 CRO/hr
- With 4x multiplier: ~5.96 CRO/hr

<Tip>
Minimum stake is 1,000 CA. You need CA tokens to claim territories.
</Tip>

### Stake Lock

Once you stake CA on a territory:
- **24-hour lock** before you can reduce the stake
- You can **increase** stake anytime during the lock
- If you lose the territory, your CA is returned

## Capturing Territories

To capture a territory:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Target">
    Find a territory on the battlefield map (enemy-owned or neutral)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Siege">
    Click Attack and select 3 soldiers for battle
  </Step>
  <Step title="Card Battle">
    Fight the defenders using the 3v3 card battle system
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim Victory">
    Win the battle to take control. Stake CA to start earning.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Requirements

- At least **3 soldiers** with **15%+ energy** each
- **CA tokens** to stake on the territory
- Not already at the **5 territory limit**

## Defending Territories

When someone attacks your territory:

1. You receive a notification
2. The territory enters "Under Siege" state
3. Your assigned defenders fight automatically via card battle
4. Win = keep territory. Lose = territory transfers to attacker.

### Assigning Defenders

Each territory needs soldiers assigned to defend it:
- Assign soldiers from your roster
- Higher power soldiers = better defense
- Keep defenders' energy high

<Warning>
Territories without strong defenders are easy targets. Check your garrisons regularly.
</Warning>

---

## Conquest Protection

After capturing a territory, you get a **3-hour protection window**:
- No one can attack you during this time
- Use it to stake CA and assign defenders
- After 3 hours, you're fair game

---

## Strategy

### Offense

- **Target weak territories** — Low defender power = easy capture
- **Check defender energy** — Tired defenders fight poorly
- **Time your attacks** — Strike when owners are likely offline

### Defense

- **Assign strong soldiers** — High power deters attackers
- **Keep energy high** — Rotate tired defenders
- **Prioritize high-value** — Defend Epic/Rare over Common

### Expansion vs Consolidation

| Strategy | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Many territories** | More total income | Harder to defend all |
| **Few territories** | Easier to defend | Lower total income |

<Tip>
3 well-defended territories often outperforms 5 poorly-defended ones.
</Tip>
