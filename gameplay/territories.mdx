# Territories

The battlefield is divided into territories. Control them to earn CRO every hour.

## How Territories Work

Each territory:
- **Generates CRO** passively while you control it
- **Can be attacked** by other players at any time
- **Must be defended** or you lose it (and the income)

## Territory States

| State | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Owned** | You control it | Collect income, defend if attacked |
| **Under Siege** | Being attacked | Defend now or lose it! |
| **Enemy** | Another player owns it | Attack to capture |
| **Neutral** | Unclaimed | Easy capture, no defenders |

## The Siege System

When someone attacks your territory, it doesn't change hands immediately. The **siege system** gives defenders time to respond.

### How Sieges Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Attacker Initiates Siege">
    An attacker selects your territory and starts a siege. This locks the territory into "Under Siege" state.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Defense Window Opens">
    You have a limited time window to respond and defend your territory.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Battle or Forfeit">
    If you defend, card combat determines the winner. If you don't respond in time, the attacker wins by default.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Siege Timer

- **Defense window:** You have time to respond before auto-capture
- **Active defense required:** Simply owning soldiers isn't enough—you must manually deploy defenders
- **Real-time notifications:** Check your alerts regularly to avoid losing territories

<Note>
The siege timer creates urgency. Active players who check in regularly have the advantage over passive holders.
</Note>

### Auto-Capture

If the defense window expires without a response:
- Territory transfers to the attacker automatically
- No battle occurs—you forfeit by absence
- Your passive income from that territory stops immediately

<Warning>
AFK = territory loss. The siege system rewards active players who engage with the game daily.
</Warning>

## Capturing Territories

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick a Target">
    Select an enemy or neutral territory on the battlefield map.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the Siege">
    Click **Attack** and select which soldiers to deploy. This begins the siege timer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait or Battle">
    The defender may respond. If they do, card combat begins. If they don't, you win automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim Your Prize">
    Territory is yours. CRO income starts immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Defending Your Territories

When someone attacks your territory:

1. You'll get a **siege notification**—check in regularly!
2. Select the territory under siege
3. Deploy defenders before the timer expires
4. Win the battle to keep control

<Warning>
Undefended territories are easy targets. Active players keep what they hold.
</Warning>

### Defense Strategy

- **Stack high-value territories:** Put your best soldiers on territories you can't afford to lose
- **Check in daily:** Sieges can happen anytime—regular logins let you respond
- **Prioritize:** If multiple territories are under siege, defend the highest-income ones first

## Territory Income

Different territories have different values:
- **Strategic locations** earn more CRO per hour
- **High-value territories** attract more attacks
- **Multiple territories** = compounding income

Your total hourly income depends on:
- Number of territories held
- Value of each territory
- How long you hold them

<Tip>
Balance expansion with defense. Holding 3 territories you can defend beats holding 10 you can't.
