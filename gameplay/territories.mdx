# Territories

The battlefield is divided into territories. Control them to earn CRO.

## How Territories Work

Each territory:
- **Generates CRO per hour** while you control it
- **Can be sieged** by other players
- **Must be defended** or you lose it

## Territory States

| State | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Owned** | You control it and earn income |
| **Under Siege** | Someone is attacking — defend or lose it! |
| **Enemy** | Controlled by another player |
| **Neutral** | Unclaimed, easy to capture |

## Capturing Territories

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a Siege">
    Click an enemy or neutral territory and select "Attack"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy Forces">
    Choose which soldiers to send
  </Step>
  <Step title="Win the Battle">
    Defeat the defenders to capture the territory
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect Income">
    Your new territory generates CRO every hour
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Defending Territories

When someone sieges your territory:
- You'll see a notification
- You can deploy defenders
- If you don't defend (or lose), you lose the territory

<Warning>
  Undefended territories are easy targets. Check your holdings regularly!
</Warning>

## Territory Income

Different territories generate different amounts of CRO per hour. Strategic locations earn more but are harder to hold.

The total CRO you earn depends on:
- Number of territories held
- Value of each territory
- How long you hold them
