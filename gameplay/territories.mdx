# Territories

The battlefield is divided into territories. Control them to earn CRO every hour.

## How Territories Work

Each territory:
- **Generates CRO** passively while you control it
- **Can be attacked** by other players at any time
- **Must be defended** or you lose it (and the income)

## Territory States

| State | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Owned** | You control it | Collect income, defend if attacked |
| **Under Siege** | Being attacked | Defend now or lose it! |
| **Enemy** | Another player owns it | Attack to capture |
| **Neutral** | Unclaimed | Easy capture, no defenders |

## Capturing Territories

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick a Target">
    Select an enemy or neutral territory on the battlefield map.

  <Step title="Start the Siege">
    Click **Attack** and select which soldiers to deploy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Win the Battle">
    Defeat the defenders in card combat.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim Your Prize">
    Territory is yours. CRO income starts immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Defending Your Territories

When someone attacks your territory:

1. You'll see a **notification** (check regularly!)
2. Deploy defenders to protect it
3. Win the battle to keep control

<Warning>
Undefended territories are easy targets. Active players keep what they hold.
</Warning>

## Territory Income

Different territories have different values:
- **Strategic locations** earn more CRO per hour
- **High-value territories** attract more attacks
- **Multiple territories** = compounding income

Your total hourly income depends on:
- Number of territories held
- Value of each territory
- How long you hold them

<Tip>
Balance expansion with defense. Holding 3 territories you can defend beats holding 10 you can't.
