# PvP Battles

PvP is where you compete for DP (Deployment Points) rewards. Two modes: **Attack** (active) and **Deploy** (passive).

## Two Modes

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Attack Mode" icon="sword">
    **Active battles.** Hunt deployed soldiers or AI. Win big, risk energy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deploy Mode" icon="shield">
    **Passive income.** Deploy your squad for guaranteed DP while AFK.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

---

## Attack Mode

Attack other players' deployed soldiers (or AI if none available).

### How It Works

1. **Find a target** — Matchmaking finds opponents in your power tier
2. **Select your squad** — Choose soldiers with enough energy
3. **Battle** — 3v3 card combat determines the winner
4. **Collect rewards** — Win or lose, you earn DP

### Rewards

| Result | vs Players | vs AI |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Victory** | 80 DP | 60 DP |
| **Defeat** | 10 DP | 10 DP |

### Energy Cost

- **Victory:** 20% of squad's average energy
- **Defeat:** 25% of squad's average energy

### Power Tiers

Matchmaking groups players into 6 tiers:

| Tier | Level |
|------|-------|
| Bronze | Lowest |
| Silver | |
| Gold | |
| Platinum | |
| Diamond | |
| Champion | Highest |

You face opponents within ±1 tier of your squad power.

<Tip>
Target slightly weaker opponents for ~80% win rate. Consistent wins beat risky gambles.

## Deploy Mode

Deploy soldiers to earn passive DP while you're away.

### Deployment Options

| Duration | Base Reward | DP per Hour |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 2 hours | 40 DP | 20 DP/hr |
| 4 hours | 120 DP | 30 DP/hr |
| 8 hours | 240 DP | 30 DP/hr |

### How It Works

1. **Select a soldier** from your roster
2. **Choose duration** — 2, 4, or 8 hours
3. **Deploy** — Soldier becomes unavailable
4. **Collect** — Get DP when deployment ends

<Note>
8-hour deployments are most efficient. Perfect for overnight or during work.
</Note>

### Defense Bonus

If attackers target your deployed soldier and **lose**, you earn bonus DP on top of your base reward.

## Strategy

### When to Attack

- **Active play sessions** — When you can monitor energy
- **Peak hours** — More players deploying = more targets

### When to Deploy

- **Overnight** — 8-hour deployment = guaranteed morning DP
- **Work/School** — Passive income while AFK

### Energy Management

| Energy Level | Recommendation |
|--------------|----------------|
| 80-100% | Attack or Deploy |
| 50-79% | Deploy only |
| 20-49% | Train to recover |
| 0-19% | Wait for regen |

<Warning>
Low-energy soldiers fight at reduced power. A 50% energy soldier is half as effective.
</Warning>
