# PvP Battles

PvP is where commanders compete for DP rewards and glory. Master both modes — Attack and Deploy — to maximize your daily earnings.

## Two Ways to Battle

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Attack Mode" icon="sword">
    **Active battles.** Hunt deployed soldiers or AI opponents. Win for big DP, lose for a small consolation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deploy Mode" icon="shield">
    **Passive income.** Deploy your squad for 2-8 hours. Earn guaranteed DP even if defeated.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Attack Mode

Attack other players' deployed soldiers (or AI opponents when none are available).

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find a Target">
    Browse available opponents matched to your power tier
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Your Squad">
    Choose soldiers for battle (higher energy = stronger)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Battle">
    Combat resolves based on soldier stats and gear
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect Rewards">
    Win or lose, you earn DP
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Rewards

| Result | vs Players | vs AI |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Victory** | 80 DP | 60 DP |
| **Defeat** | 10 DP | 10 DP |

### Energy Cost

- **Victory:** 20% of squad's average energy consumed
- **Defeat:** 25% of squad's average energy consumed

**Example:** Squad at 100% average energy loses = -25 energy per soldier

### Power Tiers

Matchmaking groups players into 6 tiers:

| Tier | Level |
|------|-------|
| Bronze | Lowest power |
| Silver | |
| Gold | |
| Platinum | |
| Diamond | |
| Champion | Highest power |

You'll face opponents within ±1 tier of your squad power.

<Tip>
Target opponents slightly weaker than your squad for a high (~80%) win rate. Consistent wins beat risky attacks.
</Tip>

## Deploy Mode

Deploy your squad to earn passive rewards while you're away.

### Deployment Options

| Duration | Base Reward | DP per Hour |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 2 hours | 40 DP | 20 DP/hr |
| 4 hours | 120 DP | 30 DP/hr |
| 8 hours | 240 DP | 30 DP/hr |

<Note>
Longer deployments are more efficient. 8-hour deployments give the same DP/hour as 4-hour but require less attention.
</Note>

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Soldier">
    Choose a soldier from your roster
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Duration">
    Pick 2, 4, or 8 hours
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Soldier becomes unavailable for the duration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect">
    Get your DP when deployment ends (win or lose)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Defense Bonus

If attackers target your deployed soldier and **lose**, you earn bonus DP:
- **Base reward** + defense bonus
- Stronger soldiers = better defense = more bonus DP

## Strategy Guide

### When to Attack

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Active Play Sessions" icon="gamepad">
    Attack during focused play time when you can monitor energy and target selection.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Peak Hours" icon="clock">
    More players deploying = more targets available in your tier.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### When to Deploy

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Overnight" icon="moon">
    8-hour deployments while you sleep = guaranteed morning DP.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Work/School" icon="briefcase">
    Deploy before leaving for passive income while AFK.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Energy Management

| Soldier Energy | Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------|
| 80-100% | Attack or Deploy — full strength |
| 50-79% | Deploy only — avoid attack losses |
| 20-49% | Train — recover while gaining XP |
| 0-19% | Rest — wait for energy recovery |

<Warning>
Attacking with low-energy soldiers dramatically reduces win rate. A 50% energy soldier fights at half power.
</Warning>

### Maximizing Daily DP

A well-optimized rotation:

1. **Morning:** Collect overnight deploy rewards. Attack with rested soldiers.
2. **Midday:** Deploy recovering soldiers. Attack with fresh ones.
3. **Evening:** Final attack push. Deploy before bed.
4. **Night:** 8-hour deployment while sleeping.

**Target:** 500-800 DP per day with consistent play.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I cancel a deployment early?">
    No. Deployments run until the timer expires or your soldier is defeated once. Plan carefully.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I lose soldiers permanently if defeated?">
    No. Defeated soldiers just need time to recover energy. No permanent losses.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I deploy and attack simultaneously?">
    Yes! You can have soldiers deployed while other soldiers attack.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if no players are available to attack?">
    AI opponents are always available. They pay 60 DP on victory (vs 80 DP for players).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How is matchmaking power calculated?">
    Sum of all soldiers' base power determines your tier. Your effective power (with current energy) is used in actual battle.
