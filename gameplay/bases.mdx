# Bases

Bases are your strategic headquarters in Cronos Army. They host your soldiers, provide facility bonuses, and can be upgraded through a tier system.

## Core Concepts

    Four facility types provide bonuses: Hospital, Forge, Barracks, Comms Center

## Minting Your First Base

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Command Center">
    Go to Command Center → Territories
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Mint New Base">
    Select the mint option
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pay the Mint Fee">
    100,000 CA + gas fees
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Transaction">
    Wait for on-chain confirmation
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your base starts at **Tier 1** with:
- Capacity for **3 soldiers**
- **4 facility slots** (one per type)
- Max facility level: **20**

## Base Tiers

Higher tier bases hold more soldiers and allow higher facility levels:

| Tier | Soldier Capacity | Max Facility Level | How to Get |
|------|------------------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | 3 | 20 | Mint directly |
| 2 | 6 | 30 | Merge two Tier 1 |
| 3 | 12 | 40 | Merge two Tier 2 |
| 4 | 24 | 50 | Merge two Tier 3 |
| 5 | 48 | 60 | Merge two Tier 4 |

## Building Facilities

Each base supports 4 facility types. Build them using Development Points (DP) earned from PvP battles.

### The Four Facilities

| Facility | Bonus | Max Bonus |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Hospital** | Energy regeneration rate | +80% |
| **Forge** | Gear drop chance during training | +50% |
| **Barracks** | Training XP gained | +100% |
| **Comms Center** | PvP DP earned | +40% |

### Building Costs

- **DP cost:** 2 DP per facility
- **Build time:** 2 hours (or instant with 2 Credits)
- **Limit:** One of each type per base

<Note>
Only soldiers **assigned to the base** benefit from facility bonuses. Soldiers not assigned to any base don't get these bonuses.
</Note>

## Upgrading Facilities

Once built, facilities start at Level 1. Upgrade them to increase their bonus.

### Upgrade Costs

| Target Level | DP Cost | Time | Credit Cost |
|-------------|---------|------|-------------|
| 2 | 10 DP | 2.8 hours | 3 Credits |
| 5 | 62 DP | 11.2 hours | 12 Credits |
| 10 | 250 DP | 31.6 hours | 32 Credits |
| 15 | 562 DP | 58.1 hours | 59 Credits |
| 20 | 1,000 DP | 89.4 hours | 90 Credits |

**Formula:**
- DP cost: `2.5 × targetLevel²`
- Time: `targetLevel^1.5 hours`

### Facility Bonuses by Level

Higher levels give bigger bonuses, but with diminishing returns:

| Level | Hospital | Barracks | Forge | Comms |
|-------|----------|----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | +3.8% | +3.2% | +2.0% | +2.5% |
| 5 | +16.0% | +14.3% | +9.1% | +13.3% |
| 10 | +26.7% | +25.0% | +14.3% | +16.0% |
| 15 | +34.3% | +33.3% | +18.8% | +20.0% |
| 20 | +40.0% | +40.0% | +22.2% | +22.9% |

<Tip>
Due to diminishing returns, it's more efficient to keep all facilities at similar levels rather than maxing one first.
</Tip>

## Merging Bases

Combine two bases of the same tier to create a higher-tier base.

### Merge Requirements

| Merge | Total Facility Levels Required |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| Tier 1 → Tier 2 | 50 levels (each base) |
| Tier 2 → Tier 3 | 100 levels (each base) |
| Tier 3 → Tier 4 | 140 levels (each base) |
| Tier 4 → Tier 5 | 180 levels (each base) |

**Example:** To merge Tier 1 bases, each needs 50 total facility levels. Four facilities at Level 13 each = 52 levels ✓

### Merge Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Validate Requirements">
    System checks both bases meet level threshold
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate New Metadata">
    New NFT metadata is prepared and uploaded to IPFS
  </Step>
  <Step title="Blockchain Transaction">
    Contract burns the 2 old NFTs and mints 1 new higher-tier NFT
  </Step>
  <Step title="Facilities Averaged">
    New base inherits averaged facility levels from both old bases
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
No active facility upgrades can be in progress on either base when merging.
</Warning>

### How Facility Averaging Works

```
Base A: Hospital(13), Forge(13), Barracks(13), Comms(13) = 52 levels
Base B: Hospital(13), Forge(11), Barracks(15), Comms(13) = 52 levels

↓ MERGE ↓

New Tier 2 Base: Hospital(13), Forge(12), Barracks(14), Comms(13) = 52 levels
```

Your progress carries over! You don't lose facility investment when merging.

## Strategy Tips

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Build All 4 First" icon="hammer">
    Get all facilities built at Level 1 before upgrading. The initial bonuses are cheap.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Level Evenly" icon="scale-balanced">
    Keep all facilities within 2-3 levels of each other for best efficiency.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Plan for Merges" icon="calculator">
    Target 13 levels each (52 total) for Tier 1 → 2 merge.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prioritize by Playstyle" icon="user">
    PvP focus → Comms. Training focus → Barracks. Active play → Hospital.
  </Card>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I downgrade or rebuild facilities?">
    No. Facility choices and upgrades are permanent. Plan carefully.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do facility bonuses stack across multiple bases?">
    No. Each base has independent bonuses. Only soldiers assigned to that base benefit.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens to facilities if I sell the base NFT?">
    Facilities transfer with the base. The new owner inherits all facility levels.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I upgrade multiple facilities at once?">
    No. Only one upgrade per facility at a time. But you can upgrade different facilities simultaneously.
