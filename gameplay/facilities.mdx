## Building Facilities

### Requirements

- Own a base territory with available facility slots
- Have 2 DP available for construction
- Only one of each facility type per base

### Construction

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Base Management">
    Navigate to your territory in the Command Center
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Facility Type">
    Choose Hospital, Forge, Barracks, or Comms Center
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Construction">
    Pay 2 DP to begin building
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait or Speed Up">
    2 hours to complete (or instant with 2 Credits)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Build all 4 facilities first before upgrading any. The initial Level 1 bonuses are cheap and stack nicely.
</Tip>

## Upgrading Facilities

Facilities start at Level 1 and can be upgraded to increase their bonus.

| 20 | 1,000 | 89.4 hours | 90 |

**Formulas:**

## Strategy Guide

### Early Game (Tier 1)

**Goal:** All 4 facilities to Level 13 for merge readiness (52 total levels)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build All Four (Day 1-2)">
    8 DP total, 8 hours if waiting (or 8 Credits for instant)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Level to 5 Each (Week 1)">
    ~360 DP total. Quick gains, noticeable bonuses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Level to 10 Each (Week 2-3)">
    ~1,200 DP additional. Strong foundation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Push to 13 Each (Week 3-4)">
    ~820 DP additional per facility. Merge ready!
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Timeline:** ~15 days at 550 DP/day

### Mid Game (Tier 2-3)

After merging, your facilities carry over at Level 13. Push toward tier caps:

| Tier | Target Level | DP per Facility |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| Tier 2 | 25 | ~11,765 DP |
| Tier 3 | 35 | ~27,563 DP |

**Strategy:** Keep all facilities within 3 levels of each other for balanced gains.

### Prioritization by Playstyle

| Playstyle | Priority Order |
|-----------|----------------|
| **PvP Grinder** | Comms → Hospital → Barracks → Forge |
| **Trainer** | Barracks → Forge → Hospital → Comms |
| **Active Player** | Hospital → Comms → Barracks → Forge |
| **Balanced** | All even levels |

## Important Notes

<Warning>
Facilities are **permanent**. You cannot downgrade, rebuild, or change your choices. Plan carefully.
</Warning>

### Activation Requirements

- Soldiers must be **assigned to the base** to benefit
- Minimum **3 soldiers** assigned for bonuses to activate
- Bonuses activate at Level 1 (immediately after building)

### Merge Carryover

When merging two bases, facility levels are **averaged**:

```
Base A: Hospital(13), Forge(13), Barracks(13), Comms(13)
Base B: Hospital(13), Forge(11), Barracks(15), Comms(13)

New Base: Hospital(13), Forge(12), Barracks(14), Comms(13)
```

No progress is lost — this is crucial for long-term progression.

    Not the same facility, but you can upgrade one Hospital AND one Forge simultaneously.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I sell my base NFT?">
