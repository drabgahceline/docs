## Personalities in Battle

Your soldier's personality affects:

1. **Special Ability** — Each personality has a unique combat move
2. **Battle Dialogue** — What they say during fights
3. **Reactions** — How they respond to hits, kills, and victories
4. **AI Behavior** — How they act when defending (as NPCs)

## Living Dialogue

Soldiers react to what's happening in battle:

- **Critical hit?** → Celebration based on personality
- **Taking damage?** → Pain response (aggressive soldiers get angry, funny ones crack jokes)
- **Killing an enemy?** → Victory taunt
- **Last one standing?** → Desperate or defiant words
- **Winning?** → Glory speech

Every battle feels different because your soldiers respond authentically.

## Building Your Army

A balanced army uses multiple personalities:

- **Aggressive + Reckless** for burst damage
- **Defensive + Stubborn** for survival
- **Intelligent** for consistent high damage
- **Inspiring** for sustain in long fights

Experiment to find combinations that fit your playstyle.
