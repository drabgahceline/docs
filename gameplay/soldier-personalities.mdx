## Personality in Battle

Your soldier's personality affects:

1. **Special Ability** — Unique combat move (see above)
2. **Battle Dialogue** — What they say during fights
3. **Reactions** — How they respond to hits, kills, victories
4. **AI Behavior** — How they act when defending as NPCs

## Building Your Army

A balanced army leverages multiple personalities:

| Strategy | Recommended Mix |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Burst Damage** | Aggressive + Reckless + Intelligent |
| **Sustained Fight** | Defensive + Inspiring + Stubborn |
| **Balanced** | Mix of damage + support personalities |

<Tip>
There's no single "best" personality. Match your army composition to your playstyle.
