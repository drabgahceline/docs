# Conquest

Conquest is how you capture territories. Attack enemy-held or neutral territories, win the card battle, and claim the land.

## How Conquest Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Target">
    Open the Battlefield map and pick a territory to attack
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Defenders">
    See the defender's soldiers and their power levels
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Your Squad">
    Choose 3 soldiers with at least 15% energy each
  </Step>
  <Step title="Battle">
    3v3 card combat against the defenders
  </Step>
  <Step title="Victory or Defeat">
    Win = capture territory. Lose = nothing happens.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Requirements

Before attacking, you need:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **3 soldiers** | Minimum squad size |
| **15%+ energy each** | Low energy soldiers can't attack |
| **CA tokens** | To stake on captured territory |
| **Under territory limit** | Max 5 territories per wallet |

<Warning>
If you already own 5 territories, you must release one before attacking.
</Warning>

## The Card Battle

Territory conquest uses the same [3v3 card battle](/gameplay/battle-system) system:

- Select actions: Attack, Defensive, or Special
- One team special per battle
- Eliminate all defenders to win

### Defender Advantage

Defenders get bonuses based on territory tier:

| Territory Tier | Defense Bonus |
|----------------|---------------|
| Common | +5% |
| Rare | +10% |
| Epic | +15% |

This means attackers need slightly stronger squads to win reliably.

## After Victory

When you capture a territory:

1. **3-hour protection** — No one can attack you immediately
2. **Stake CA tokens** — Required to start earning CRO
3. **Assign defenders** — Protect your new territory
4. **Income starts** — Earn CRO every hour

## After Defeat

If you lose the attack:
- Your soldiers lose energy (battle fatigue)
- Territory stays with current owner
- You can try again when soldiers recover

---

## Neutral Territories

Some territories have no owner (neutral). These are easier to capture:
- No player defenders
- May have AI defenders or none
- Good targets for new players

## Strategy

### Choosing Targets

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Check Power Levels" icon="eye">
    Compare your squad power to defender power. Aim for 20%+ advantage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Energy Matters" icon="battery-full">
    Tired defenders fight poorly. Attack when defenders look low.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Squad Composition

- **Bring damage** — Aggressive, Intelligent, Reckless for kills
- **Bring sustain** — Inspiring, Relaxed for longer fights
- **Counter personalities** — If defenders are Aggressive, Stubborn reflects well

### Timing

- **Off-peak hours** — Owners less likely to notice and reinforce
- **After other battles** — Defenders might be recovering energy
- **Coordinate with allies** — Multiple attackers can overwhelm a region

<Tip>
Epic territories are heavily defended. Start with Common/Rare to build experience.
