# Conquest

Conquest Mode is where commanders fight for territorial control. Capture enemy bases to earn prestige, resources, and leaderboard rankings.

## How Conquest Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find a Target">
    Open the Territory Map and identify enemy-controlled territories within attack range
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scout (Optional)">
    Spend energy to reveal enemy garrison strength and composition
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch Attack">
    Select your attack squad and pay the energy cost
  </Step>
  <Step title="Battle">
    Combat resolves against the defender's garrison
  </Step>
  <Step title="Victory or Defeat">
    Win: capture territory. Lose: retreat and recover.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Attack Range

You can attack any territory within **5 hexes** of any base you own.

| Your Base | Attack Range |
|-----------|--------------|
| Position (10, 10) | Can attack (10, 15), (15, 10), etc. |
| Multiple bases | Attack from any of them |

<Tip>
Owning multiple territories expands your attack range dramatically. Strategic positioning matters.
</Tip>

## Scouting

Before committing to an attack, scout the target.

### Scout Mechanics

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Energy cost** | 10 energy |
| **Success rate** | 50% base + 5% per Comms Hub level |
| **Info revealed** | Garrison composition, facility levels, recent battles |

### When to Scout

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="High-Value Targets" icon="gem">
    Always scout before attacking strategic territories worth the investment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unknown Defenders" icon="question">
    New enemies or territories you haven't attacked before.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
Failed scouts consume energy but reveal nothing. Higher Comms Hub levels reduce this risk.
</Warning>

## Attack Costs

| Resource | Base Cost | With Barracks L10 |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Energy** | 40 | 20 |

Your soldiers lose energy whether you win or lose. Plan your attacks carefully.

## Capture Rewards

### On Victory

| Reward | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| **Territory ownership** | Full control |
| **DP** | 150 |
| **WPP** | +20 |
| **Passive bonuses** | From territory multiplier |

### On Defeat

| Outcome | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Energy loss** | Soldiers need recovery |
| **Territory** | Stays with defender |
| **DP** | None |

## Cooldowns

After attacking a territory, you cannot attack **that same territory** again for:

| Comms Hub Level | Cooldown |
|-----------------|----------|
| 0 | 24 hours |
| 5 | 19 hours |
| 10 | 14 hours (minimum) |

**Important:** Cooldown is per-territory. You can attack multiple different territories without waiting.

## Defense

### Setting Up Defense

Protect your territories by:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Garrison Soldiers" icon="shield">
    Assign 3-5 soldiers to each base. They defend automatically when attacked.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Upgrade Facilities" icon="building">
    Higher facility levels = higher defense rating = deters attackers.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Defense Rating

Attackers see your defense rating before attacking:

```
Defense Rating = (Garrison Power × 2) + Total Facility Levels
```

**Example:** 600 garrison power + 25 facility levels = 1,225 defense rating

High defense ratings deter casual attackers.

### When Attacked

If someone attacks your territory while you're offline:
- Your garrison defends automatically
- You'll see battle results when you log in
- If you lose, you can immediately reclaim (no cooldown)

## Reclamation

Lost a territory? You can attack it immediately — no cooldown applies for reclaiming your own territories.

<Note>
Reclamation battles work like normal conquest. You still need enough energy and a strong squad.
</Note>

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive Strategy

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Scout First" icon="binoculars">
    Always scout targets worth 40+ energy investment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Target Weak Neighbors" icon="crosshairs">
    Look for low defense ratings and inactive players.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Chain Attacks" icon="link">
    Own multiple territories to bypass single-target cooldowns.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Timing Matters" icon="clock">
    Attack when garrisons are likely recovering from other battles.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Defensive Strategy

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Rotate Garrison" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Swap in fresh soldiers after successful defenses.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Upgrade Evenly" icon="scale-balanced">
    All facilities contribute to defense rating.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Strategic Positioning" icon="map">
    Territories surrounded by allies are harder to attack.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Decoy Bases" icon="mask">
    Garrison one base heavily, leave others light. Attackers waste energy on the strong one.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Advanced Tactics

| Tactic | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Territory Flipping** | Trade territories with allies for mutual DP gains. Risky if others notice. |
| **Siege Warfare** | Attack same territory repeatedly after cooldown. Forces defender to maintain strong garrison. |
| **Expansion Waves** | Claim multiple adjacent territories in one day. Hard to defend but creates strategic blocks. |
| **Feint Attacks** | Attack heavily defended base with weak squad (expected loss). Defender relaxes, then strike with elites. |
