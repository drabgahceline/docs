# Energy System

Soldiers need energy to fight. No energy = no battles.

## How Energy Works

- Every soldier has an **energy bar** (0-100%)
- **Battles consume energy** (amount depends on battle length)
- **Energy regenerates over time** automatically
- **Low energy soldiers can't enter battles**

## Energy Threshold

Soldiers need **minimum 20% energy** to enter a battle.

<Warning>
  A soldier at 19% energy cannot fight until they recover!
</Warning>

## Recovery Methods

### Passive Regeneration
Energy regenerates automatically over time. Just wait.

### Active Recovery
- Use **Credits** to instantly restore energy
- More credits = faster recovery

## Strategic Considerations

<Tip>
  **Rotate your army.** Don't send the same soldiers into every battle. Let tired soldiers rest while fresh ones fight.
</Tip>

### Army Management Tips

1. **Check energy before sieges** — Don't start a fight with exhausted soldiers
2. **Keep reserves** — Always have backup soldiers ready
3. **Time your attacks** — Big assault coming? Make sure everyone's charged
4. **Use credits wisely** — Save instant recovery for critical moments

## Energy Display

In the battlefield UI:
- **Green bar** = High energy, ready to fight
- **Yellow bar** = Medium energy, can still battle
- **Red bar** = Low energy, limited or no battles

Your soldier's power is not affected by energy — when they fight, they fight at full strength. Energy just determines if they CAN fight.
