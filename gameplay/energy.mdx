# Energy System

Soldiers need energy to fight and train. Managing energy is part of your strategy.

## How Energy Works

- Every soldier has an **energy bar** (0-100%)
- **Actions consume energy** (battles, training)
- **Energy regenerates** automatically over time
- **Minimum 20% energy** required to enter battle

<Warning>
A soldier at 19% energy cannot fight until they recover past 20%.
</Warning>

## Energy Costs

### Battle Costs

| Action | Energy Cost |
|--------|-------------|
| Attack (per soldier) | 5% |
| Defend (per soldier) | 2% |
| Defeat penalty | +15% |
| Retreat (Round 1) | +5% |
| Retreat (Round 2) | +10% |

### Training Costs

| Training Type | Energy Cost |
|---------------|-------------|
| Active Training | 15% |
| Passive Training | 15% |

## Energy Recovery

### Passive Regeneration (Free)

Energy recovers automatically over time:

| Condition | Recovery Rate |
|-----------|---------------|
| Base rate | 10% per hour |
| With Hospital facility | Up to 15% per hour |

**Time to full recovery (0→100%):** ~10 hours base, ~7 hours with Hospital

### Instant Recovery (Credits)

Spend Credits to restore energy immediately:

| Action | Cost |
|--------|------|
| Per 1% energy | 0.05 credits |
| Full recharge (0→100%) | 5 credits |
| 50% recharge | 2.5 credits |

<Tip>
Only use instant recovery for urgent situations — passive regen is free.
</Tip>

## Energy & Combat Power

**Important:** Energy does NOT affect how hard your soldier hits.

When your soldier enters battle, they fight at **full power** regardless of energy level. Energy only determines whether they CAN enter — not how well they perform.

| Energy | Can Battle? | Combat Power |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 100% | ✅ Yes | Full |
| 50% | ✅ Yes | Full |
| 20% | ✅ Yes | Full |
| 19% | ❌ No | — |

## Strategic Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rotate Your Army">
    Don't send the same soldiers into every battle. Let tired soldiers rest while fresh ones fight.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check Before Sieges">
    Before starting a siege, verify your chosen soldiers have enough energy. Getting stuck mid-campaign is frustrating.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep Reserves">
    Always have backup soldiers ready. If your mains are exhausted and you get attacked, you need defenders.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Save Credits for Emergencies">
    Don't blow credits on routine recovery. Save instant recharges for critical defenses or time-sensitive attacks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Hospital Facilities">
    Upgrade your Hospital facility to boost regeneration rate. The difference adds up over time.

## Energy Display

In the UI, soldier energy shows as a colored bar:

- 🟢 **Green** (60-100%) — High energy, fully ready
- 🟡 **Yellow** (20-59%) — Medium energy, battle-capable  
- 🔴 **Red** (0-19%) — Low energy, cannot battle

Plan your campaigns around your army's energy state.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do defenders lose energy?">
    Yes, but less than attackers. Defenders pay 2% per soldier vs 5% for attackers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does energy affect training?">
    You need 15% energy to start training, but energy level doesn't affect XP earned.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I run out mid-battle?">
    You can't run out mid-battle. Energy is deducted when you enter. Once in, you fight until the end.
