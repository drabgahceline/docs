# Energy System

Soldiers need energy to fight. Managing energy is part of your strategy.

## How Energy Works

- Every soldier has an **energy bar** (0-100%)
- **Battles consume energy** based on battle length
- **Energy regenerates** automatically over time
- **Minimum 20% energy** required to enter battle

<Warning>
A soldier at 19% energy cannot fight until they recover past 20%.
</Warning>

## Energy & Combat Power

**Important:** Energy does NOT affect how hard your soldier hits.

When your soldier enters battle, they fight at **full power** regardless of energy level. Energy only determines whether they CAN enter — not how well they perform.

| Energy | Can Battle? | Combat Power |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 100% | ✅ Yes | Full |
| 50% | ✅ Yes | Full |
| 20% | ✅ Yes | Full |
| 19% | ❌ No | — |

## Recovery Options

### Passive Regeneration

Energy recovers automatically over time. Just wait. This is free but slow.

### Credit Recovery

Spend **Credits** to instantly restore energy. Useful when you need soldiers ready NOW.

## Strategic Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rotate Your Army">
    Don't send the same soldiers into every battle. Let tired soldiers rest while fresh ones fight.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check Before Sieges">
    Before starting a siege, verify your chosen soldiers have enough energy. Getting stuck mid-campaign is frustrating.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep Reserves">
    Always have backup soldiers ready. If your mains are exhausted and you get attacked, you need defenders.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Save Credits for Emergencies">
    Don't blow credits on routine recovery. Save instant recharges for critical defenses or time-sensitive attacks.
  </Accordion>

## Energy Display

In the UI, soldier energy shows as a colored bar:

- 🟢 **Green** — High energy, ready to fight
- 🟡 **Yellow** — Medium energy, still battle-capable  
- 🔴 **Red** — Low energy, limited or no battles

Plan your campaigns around your army's energy state.
