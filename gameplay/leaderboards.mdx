# Leaderboards

Cronos Army features multiple leaderboards that reward consistent play with real cash and exclusive titles.

## WPP Leaderboard

The War Participation Points (WPP) leaderboard tracks weekly battle activity. Higher WPP = better ranking = bigger rewards.

### How WPP Is Earned

|----------|------------|
| Training (1h) | 1 WPP |
| Training (4h) | 4 WPP |
| Training (12h) | 12 WPP |
| Training (24h) | 24 WPP |
| PvP Attack (start battle) | 5 WPP |
| PvP Attack (win bonus) | +10 WPP |
| PvP Deploy (per hour) | 1 WPP |
| PvP Deploy (win bonus) | +5 WPP |
| Territory Attack | 5 WPP |
| Territory Conquest | +20 WPP |

| Facility Upgrade | 10 WPP per level |

## Commander Leaderboard

The Commander leaderboard ranks players by total Commander Discipline Points (CDP) — a permanent measure of your dedication to the Cronos Army.

### What CDP Represents

CDP accumulates from daily discipline checks:
- Complete **Train** check: +1 CDP
- Complete **Engage** check: +1 CDP  

**Max 2 CDP per day.** Unlike WPP, CDP never resets. It represents your total lifetime commitment.

## Referral Leaderboard

Weekly ranking based on referred mint revenue. Top 5 split the reward pool.

| Rank | Pool Share |
|------|------------|
| #1 | 40% |
| #2 | 25% |
| #3 | 15% |
| #4 | 10% |
| #5 | 10% |

**Base pool:** $20 + 10% of all referred mint revenue.
