## Zombie Stats

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Max Supply** | 777 |
| **Rank** | Zombie |
| **Unit** | Undead Unit |
| **Mint Price** | 75 CRO |
| **Chain** | Cronos only |

## Zombie Bonuses

Zombie Soldiers have permanent bonuses that make them superior in combat:

### 2x Energy Recovery

Zombies recover energy **twice as fast** as regular soldiers.

| Soldier Type | Base Recovery | With Hospital L10 |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Regular | 10/hour | 12.67/hour |
| **Zombie** | 20/hour | 25.34/hour |

This means:
- Full recovery in 5 hours instead of 10
- More battles per day
- Less downtime between activities

### 1.2x Power Multiplier

Zombie power is multiplied by 1.2 after all other calculations.

**Example:**
- Regular soldier: 100 base power = 100 effective power
- **Zombie soldier:** 100 base power × 1.2 = **120 effective power**

This stacks with:
- XP bonuses
- Gear bonuses
- Rank bonuses

<Note>
The power multiplier makes Zombies roughly 20% stronger in combat compared to equivalent regular soldiers.
</Note>

## Why Zombies Are Valuable

### PvP Advantage

| Scenario | Regular | Zombie |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Battles per day | ~8 | ~16 |
| Win rate (same opponent) | Base | +20% |
| DP earned potential | Base | ~2x |

### Training Efficiency

Faster energy recovery means:
- More training sessions per day
- Faster XP accumulation
- More gear drop opportunities

### Territory Defense

Zombies on garrison duty:
- Recover faster after defending
- Stronger baseline defense
- Deter more attackers

## How to Get Zombies

### Minting

If Zombie minting is still active:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Availability">
    Visit the mint page to see remaining supply
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Wallet">
    Ensure you have 75+ CRO in your wallet
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mint">
    Complete the transaction to receive your Zombie
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Once all 777 Zombies are minted, no more will ever be created. The only way to get one is through secondary markets.
</Warning>

### Secondary Markets

If minting is sold out:
- In-game marketplace

- Direct trades with other players

Zombie prices on secondary markets vary based on:
- Remaining supply
