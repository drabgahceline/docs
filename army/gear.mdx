# Gear

Gear adds power to your soldiers. Find it through training, equip it, and dominate battles.

## How Gear Works

- Each soldier can equip **up to 3 gear items**
- Each gear piece adds a **flat power bonus**
- Power bonus applies to all combat (attack and defense)

<Note>
Gear simply makes your soldier stronger. There's no separate attack vs defense stats — just raw power.
</Note>

## Gear Types

| Type | Slot |
|------|------|
| ⚔️ **Weapon** | Offensive equipment |
| 🛡️ **Armor** | Body protection |
| 📿 **Accessory** | Misc equipment |

Each type can have one item equipped at a time. Three slots, three items max.

## Rarity & Power

Gear comes in four rarities:

| Rarity | Power Bonus |
|--------|-------------|
| ⬜ **Common** | +1 to +3 |
| 🟦 **Rare** | +4 to +7 |
| 🟪 **Epic** | +8 to +12 |
| 🟨 **Legendary** | +15 to +24 |

Higher rarity = bigger power boost.

## Getting Gear

### Training Drops

Gear drops from **active training** based on your accuracy grade:

| Grade | Drop Chance |
|-------|-------------|
| Perfect (85%+) | 30% |
| Great (70%+) | 10% |
| Good (55%+) | 7% |
| OK | 5% |

<Tip>
Passive training also has a chance to drop gear, but at a lower rate.
</Tip>

### Commander Level Rewards

Specific named gear unlocks at certain commander levels. Once unlocked, these items enter your drop pool with fixed power values (often better than random drops).

### Bundles

Some soldier bundles include guaranteed gear pieces.

## Equipping Gear

1. Go to **Soldiers** page
2. Select a soldier
3. Click the **Gear** tab
4. Click an item to equip or unequip

<Warning>
Each gear item can only be equipped to **one soldier** at a time. Unequip first to move it.
</Warning>

## Power Example

A soldier with full gear:

| Source | Power |
|--------|-------|
| Base (Captain rank) | 250 |
| Epic Weapon | +10 |
| Rare Armor | +5 |
| Epic Accessory | +11 |
| **Total** | **276** |

That +26 from gear can decide close battles.

## NFT Gear

Some gear can be minted as **NFTs**:

- **Tradeable** on the marketplace
- **On-chain ownership** — truly yours
- **Cross-chain** — works on Cronos & BNB

Regular (non-NFT) gear is account-bound and cannot be traded.
