## Rarity Tiers

Gear comes in four rarity levels:

| Rarity | Color | Stat Boost | Drop Rate |
|--------|-------|------------|-----------|
| **Common** | Gray | Low | Most frequent |
| **Rare** | Blue | Medium | Uncommon |
| **Epic** | Purple | High | Rare |
| **Legendary** | Gold | Maximum | Very rare |

<Tip>
Higher rarity = bigger stat boosts. But even Common gear is better than no gear.
</Tip>

## How to Get Gear

### Training Drops

Complete **active training** drills with good accuracy:

| Grade | Drop Chance |
|-------|-------------|
| Perfect | 30% |
| Great | 10% |
| Good | 7% |
| OK | 5% |

<Note>
Passive training does **not** drop gear — only active training.
</Note>

## Stat Boosts

Gear boosts your soldier's combat stats:

| Stat | Effect in Battle |
|------|------------------|
| **Attack** | More damage dealt |
| **Defense** | Less damage taken |
| **Speed** | Act earlier in turn order |
| **HP Bonus** | Extra health pool |

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do stats stack?">
    Yes. All equipped gear stats add together. A soldier with 4 Epic pieces will significantly outperform one with no gear.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I move gear between soldiers?">
    Yes. Unequip from one soldier, equip on another. Gear is account-bound until minted as NFT.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the best gear setup?">
    Depends on your soldier's role. Attackers want Weapon + offensive Accessory. Defenders want Armor + Helmet. Mix and match.
  </Accordion>

## Gear Strategy

### For Attackers
Focus on **Weapon** and offensive **Accessory**. Max damage output.

### For Defenders
Focus on **Armor** and **Helmet**. Survive longer, hold territories.

### For All-Rounders
Balance all slots. Good for soldiers who do everything.

<Tip>
Check your soldier's personality. Aggressive soldiers benefit more from attack gear. Defensive personalities shine with protection gear.
