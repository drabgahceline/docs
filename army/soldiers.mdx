## Soldier Ownership

Your soldiers are NFTs on the Cronos blockchain. You truly own them:

- **Trade freely** — Sell or transfer anytime
- **Full control** — No one can take them from you
- **Persistent history** — Battle records follow the soldier

<Note>
Soldiers remember their battles even if they change owners. A veteran soldier brings their experience with them.
