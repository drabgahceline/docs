  <Accordion title="Prioritize your best soldiers">
    Give your highest-level soldiers the best gear. They're doing the heavy lifting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Match gear to roles">
    - **Attackers:** Prioritize weapons for damage
    - **Defenders:** Prioritize armor for survivability
    - **All-rounders:** Balance across slots
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Farm higher difficulties">
    Hard and Legendary missions have much better drop rates for Epic/Legendary gear. Worth the risk if your soldiers can handle it.
