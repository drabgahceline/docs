# Rarity & Stats

Soldier rarity determines their base power level.

## Rarity Tiers

| Rarity | Base Power | Drop Rate |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Common | 80-100 | 60% |
| Uncommon | 100-130 | 25% |
| Rare | 130-170 | 10% |
| Epic | 170-220 | 4% |
| Legendary | 220-300 | 1% |

<Note>
  Higher rarity = stronger soldier, but a well-commanded Common can beat a poorly-used Legendary.

## Stats Explained

### Power
Your soldier's attack strength. Higher power = more damage dealt.

### Health
How much damage they can absorb before being eliminated. Higher health = more survivability.

### Personality
Not a "stat" but equally important. Determines special ability and battlefield behavior.

## Rarity vs Strategy

**Rarity matters, but it's not everything.**

- A Legendary soldier with the wrong personality for your strategy might underperform
- A well-synergized team of Commons can punch above their weight
- Knowing when to use specials matters more than raw stats
