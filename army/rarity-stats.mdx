# Rarity & Stats

Soldier rarity determines base power level. Higher rarity = stronger baseline stats.

## Rarity Tiers

| Rarity | Power Range | Drop Rate |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Common** | 80-100 | 60% |
| **Uncommon** | 100-130 | 25% |
| **Rare** | 130-170 | 10% |
| **Epic** | 170-220 | 4% |
| **Legendary** | 220-300 | 1% |

<Note>
Rarity affects base stats, but **strategy beats stats**. A well-played Common team can beat a poorly-played Legendary team.
</Note>

## Stats Explained

### Power

Your soldier's attack strength. Higher power = more damage dealt per hit.

### Health

How much damage your soldier can absorb before being eliminated. Higher health = more survivability, more turns to deal damage.

### Personality

Not a "stat" but equally important. Determines:
- Special ability in combat
- Dialogue and reactions
- AI behavior when defending

## Rarity vs Strategy

**Rarity matters, but it's not everything.**

    Knowing when to use Shield Wall, Rally, or Piercing Strike matters more than raw power numbers.

  <Accordion title="Experience Counts">
    Understanding enemy AI patterns and timing your attacks well beats brute force.

## Building Your Collection

Start with what you have. As you play:
- Earn rewards to acquire better soldiers
- Learn which personalities fit your style
- Build toward a balanced, synergized army

<Tip>
Don't chase rarity for its own sake. A Legendary soldier with a personality you never use is less valuable than an Uncommon that fits your strategy perfectly.
