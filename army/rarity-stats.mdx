# Ranks & Power

Every soldier NFT has a **rank** — a military designation that determines base power and scarcity. Higher ranks are strictly limited in supply.

## Rank Hierarchy

| Rank | Max Supply | Power Multiplier |
|------|------------|------------------|
| **Private** | 10,000 | 1.0x |
| **Corporal** | 5,000 | 1.3x |
| **Sergeant** | 2,500 | 1.6x |
| **Captain** | 1,000 | 2.5x |
| **Major** | 500 | 3.2x |
| **Colonel** | 250 | 4.0x |
| **General** | 100 | 5.0x |
| **Legendary** | 40 | Special |

<Note>
Colonel, General, and Legendary ranks are **sold out** — the only way to get them is secondary market.
</Note>

## How Rank Affects Combat

Rank determines your soldier's **power multiplier** in battle:

- **Base Power:** All soldiers start with 100 base power
- **Rank Multiplier:** Applied to base power (e.g., Captain = 100 × 2.5 = 250 power)
- **Battle Calculation:** Higher power = higher damage dealt

### Example

A **Captain** (2.5x) fighting a **Private** (1.0x):
- Captain effective power: 250
- Private effective power: 100
- Captain has significant advantage, but randomness and [personality specials](/army/personalities) can swing fights

## Scarcity = Value

The rank system creates natural scarcity:

- **Lower ranks** (Private, Corporal): Accessible, good for building squads
- **Mid ranks** (Sergeant, Captain): Balanced power and availability
- **High ranks** (Major, Colonel): Rare, significant power advantage
- **Top ranks** (General, Legendary): Extremely limited, collector items

<Warning>
Supply caps are enforced on-chain. Once a rank sells out, no more can ever be minted.
</Warning>

## Rank vs Strategy

Rank matters, but it's not everything:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Numbers Beat Power">
    Three Privates can overwhelm one Captain. Building a balanced squad matters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Personalities Add Variables">
    A well-timed Shield Wall or Rally can turn a losing fight. See [Personalities](/army/personalities).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Territory Defense Bonus">
    Defenders get bonuses based on territory tier. Your rank isn't the only factor.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Checking Supply

Current supply for each rank is visible in the [Recruit](/gameplay/recruiting) section. Live data is pulled from the blockchain.

<Tip>
Major is down to under 100 remaining. If you want higher ranks, the window is closing.
