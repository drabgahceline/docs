# AI Memory

This is what makes Cronos Army different. **Your soldiers remember.**

## How Memory Works

When your soldier kills an enemy, they remember:
- The enemy's name
- When it happened
- How many times they've killed them

The next time they face that enemy? They call them out by name.

## Rivalries

Kill the same enemy multiple times and a **rivalry** forms.

Your soldiers' dialogue becomes:
- More personal
- More intense
- More satisfying

"We meet again..." becomes more than a line. It's history.

## Memory in Battle

During combat, soldiers with memories might say:

> "Back for more, Marcus? You should've stayed dead."

> "I remember you. Three times I've put you down. Let's make it four."

> "You killed my friend last week. Time to settle the score."

## This Is Just The Beginning

Soldier Memory is **Stage 1** of our AI roadmap.

### What's Coming

- **Teammate Bonds** — Soldiers who fight together develop relationships
- **Grudges** — Get killed by someone? Your soldier remembers
- **Personality Evolution** — Battle experiences shape who they become
- **Persistent Stories** — Your army's history, written by their actions

## The Vision

We're not building soldiers that fight for you.

We're building soldiers that fight *with* you — soldiers that remember why they're fighting.

*Your soldiers are learning. And they never forget.*
