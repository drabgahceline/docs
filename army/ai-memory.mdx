# AI Memory

This is what makes Cronos Army different. **Your soldiers remember.**

## How Memory Works

When your soldier kills an enemy, they store that memory:
- The enemy's name
- When it happened  
- How many times they've killed them

The next time they face that same enemy? They know. And they'll let them know.

## Rivalries

Kill the same enemy multiple times and a **rivalry** develops.

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Kill">
    Your soldier notes the enemy. "I'll remember you."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Encounter">
    Recognition. "We meet again..."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rivalry Forms">
    After multiple kills, it becomes personal. Dialogue intensifies.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Memory in Battle

Soldiers with memories of their opponents say things like:

> "Back for more, Marcus? You should've stayed dead."

> "I remember you. Three times I've put you down. Let's make it four."

> "You killed my friend last week. Time to settle the score."

Every battle has history. Every rematch carries weight.

## The AI Roadmap

Soldier Memory is **Stage 1** of our AI evolution. Here's what's coming:

  <Card title="Teammate Bonds" icon="handshake">
    Soldiers who fight together develop relationships and preferred partners.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Grudges" icon="skull">
    Get killed by someone? Your soldier remembers — and wants revenge.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Personality Evolution" icon="seedling">
    Battle experiences gradually shape and evolve personalities.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Persistent Stories" icon="book">
    Your army's history, written by their actions across hundreds of battles.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The Vision

We're not building soldiers that fight for you.

We're building soldiers that fight **with** you — soldiers that remember why they're fighting, who they're fighting against, and what they're fighting for.

<Note>
*Your soldiers are learning. And they never forget.*
