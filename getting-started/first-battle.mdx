## Battle Basics

Cronos Army uses **turn-based card combat**. You're in control.

### Your Turn

Each turn, you choose:
1. **Which soldier attacks**
2. **What action they take** (Attack, Defend, or Special)
3. **Who they target**

### Combat Stances

| Stance | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Attack** | Maximum damage, no protection |
| **Defensive** | Reduced damage, but you take less too |
| **Special** | Unique ability based on soldier personality |

### Personality Powers

Your soldier's personality determines their special move:

- **Aggressive** → Piercing Strike (ignores defense)
- **Intelligent** → Analyze Weakness (bonus damage)
- **Reckless** → All-In (massive damage, risky)
- **Defensive** → Shield Wall (major damage reduction)
- **Mysterious** → Shadow Step (chance to dodge)

## Winning & Rewards

**Win the battle:**
- Capture or defend the territory
- Earn **25 WPP** (5 base + 20 victory bonus)
- Territory generates CRO per hour while you hold it

**Lose the battle:**
- Earn **5 WPP** just for participating
- Learn from defeat and try again

  Even losing battles earn you WPP. Stay active and you'll climb the weekly leaderboard.

## What's WPP?

War Participation Points (WPP) track your weekly activity. At the end of each week, the reward pool is distributed based on WPP rankings.

More battles = more WPP = bigger rewards.
