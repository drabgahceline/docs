# Security Best Practices

Your soldiers are valuable NFTs. Your wallet holds real assets. Here's how to keep them safe.

## Wallet Security Basics

<Warning>
**Never share your seed phrase or private key with anyone.** Not support staff, not team members, not friends. No legitimate service will ever ask for it.
</Warning>

### Seed Phrase Rules

Your seed phrase (12 or 24 words) is the master key to your wallet:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="✅ DO" icon="check">
    - Write it on paper
    - Store in multiple secure locations
    - Keep it offline
    - Tell no one
  </Card>
  <Card title="❌ DON'T" icon="xmark">
    - Screenshot it
    - Store in notes/email/cloud
    - Type it anywhere except wallet recovery
    - Share with "support" or "team"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Password Protection

- Use a **strong, unique password** for your wallet
- Enable **biometric lock** on mobile wallets
- Consider a **hardware wallet** for large holdings

## Common Scams to Avoid

### Fake Support Messages

<Warning>
**No one from Cronos Army will DM you first.** We don't have "support agents" who contact you privately.
</Warning>

If someone DMs you claiming to be support:
1. It's a scam
2. Block and report them
3. Never click their links
4. Never share your seed phrase

### Fake Websites

Always verify you're on the real site:

| Real | Fake Examples |
|------|---------------|
| `croarmy.site` | `croarmy.com`, `cronos-army.site`, `croarmy-game.com` |
| `cronos.army` | `cronos-army.xyz`, `cronosarmy.io` |

<Tip>
Bookmark the official site. Type it manually. Don't trust search results or links from strangers.
</Tip>

### Too-Good-To-Be-True Offers

Red flags:
- "Free NFT giveaway — just connect wallet"
- "Airdrop claim — connect to receive"
- "Exclusive mint — only 100 spots"
- "Send X to receive 2X back"

**If it sounds too good to be true, it is.**

### Wallet Draining Approvals

When connecting to sites, you may be asked to "approve" transactions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Safe Approvals">
    - Minting your soldiers (one-time)
    - Buying credits (specific amount)
    - Listed marketplace sales
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Dangerous Approvals">
    - "Unlimited" or "Max" token approvals
    - Approving access to all your NFTs
    - Any approval on a site you don't recognize
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Read what you're signing.** If a transaction looks wrong, reject it.

## Safe Gameplay Practices

### Use a Dedicated Gaming Wallet

Consider separating your assets:

| Wallet | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| **Main Wallet** | Long-term holdings, valuable NFTs |
| **Gaming Wallet** | Soldiers, in-game CRO, active play assets |

This limits exposure if something goes wrong.

### Verify Contract Addresses

Official Cronos Army contracts:

| Asset | Chain | Address |
|-------|-------|---------|
| CA Token | Cronos | `0x444075EA64D69bf5002aE1A7F44642e46f8B56d4` |
| CA Token | BNB | `0x66Daa21E4A2199f80dBBb6C7e6a4eBB4CA0E46Ce` |
| Soldiers | Cronos | `0x7b000e728296afe97fb120d7fbdfb3d55816373f` |

<Note>
When in doubt, ask in the official Discord before interacting with any contract.
</Note>

### Revoke Unused Approvals

Periodically check and revoke old token approvals:
- [revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash) — Multi-chain approval manager
- [Debank](https://debank.com) — Portfolio + approvals view

Remove approvals for sites you no longer use.

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Wallet Compromised

If you think your wallet is compromised:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Don't Panic">
    Acting fast but carefully is better than panicking
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transfer Assets">
    Move remaining assets to a NEW wallet immediately
  </Step>
  <Step title="Revoke Approvals">
    Revoke all token approvals on the compromised wallet
  </Step>
  <Step title="Report">
    Report the incident in Discord (not DMs, public channels only)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Got Scammed

If you sent assets to a scammer:
- Assets are likely unrecoverable (blockchain transactions are final)
- Report the scammer's address to the community
- Learn from it and help warn others

### Suspicious Activity

See something suspicious?
- Report in Discord's #bug-report or #general-chat
- Don't engage with the scammer
- Warn other community members
