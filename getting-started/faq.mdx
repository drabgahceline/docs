  <Accordion title="What is Cronos Army?">
    Cronos Army is a Web3 strategy game on the Cronos blockchain where you command an army of AI-powered soldiers. Your soldiers have unique personalities, remember their battle history, and develop over time. It's not just collecting—it's building a living army.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need cryptocurrency to play?">
    You need a Cronos-compatible wallet (like MetaMask) to connect and play. The game uses CRO for transactions and Credits as the in-game currency. You can earn Credits through gameplay or purchase them directly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get soldiers?">
    New players can claim free soldiers using Credits from the Barracks. Each soldier is a unique NFT with randomized stats and personality traits. You can also acquire soldiers through the marketplace.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What makes soldiers different from each other?">
    Every soldier has:
    - **Rarity tier** (Common → Legendary) affecting base stats
    - **Unique personality** influencing battle behavior and dialogue
    - **AI memory** that builds from their experiences
    - **Individual stats** (Attack, Defense, Intelligence, Speed, Stamina)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the battle system work?">
    Battles are automated—your soldiers fight based on their stats and personalities. Higher Attack helps deal damage, Defense reduces incoming damage, Intelligence affects tactical decisions, Speed determines turn order, and Stamina impacts endurance. Deploy your soldiers to territories and let them fight!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is Energy and how does it work?">
    Energy is the action resource in Cronos Army. Soldiers need energy to participate in battles and activities. Energy regenerates over time, so you don't need to spend money to keep playing—just manage your deployments wisely.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are territories?">
    The game map is divided into contested territories. Deploy soldiers to capture and defend them. Controlling territories earns you WPP (War Power Points) and other rewards. Strategic positioning matters—some territories are more valuable than others.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are Credits used for?">
    Credits are the primary in-game currency used for:
    - Claiming new soldiers from the Barracks
    - Purchasing items and upgrades
    - Various in-game activities
    
    You earn Credits through gameplay or can purchase them directly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is WPP (War Power Points)?">
    WPP measures your army's influence and combat effectiveness. It's earned through:
    - Winning battles
    - Holding territories
    - Completing objectives
    
    Higher WPP unlocks better rewards and leaderboard positions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is this game free-to-play?">
    You can start playing with free soldiers and earn Credits through gameplay. The game is designed so skilled players can progress without spending—though purchasing Credits can accelerate your growth.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What blockchain is this on?">
    Cronos Army runs on the **Cronos blockchain**. You'll need CRO (Cronos native token) for gas fees and transactions. Set up MetaMask with the Cronos network to play.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are my soldiers NFTs?">
    Yes! Every soldier is a unique ERC-721 NFT that you own. You can trade, sell, or transfer them freely. Their personality, stats, and AI memory are all stored on-chain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do soldier personalities work?">
    Each soldier has personality traits that affect how they behave in battle and interact with you. Some soldiers are aggressive attackers, others are defensive strategists. Their AI memory means they "remember" past battles and can reference them in dialogue—your army literally learns and grows.
