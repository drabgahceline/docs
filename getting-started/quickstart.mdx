# Quick Start Guide

New commander? Here's exactly what to do in your first 5 minutes.

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet (30 seconds)

1. Go to [cronos.army](https://cronos.army)
2. Click **Connect Wallet**
3. Select your wallet (MetaMask, DeFi Wallet, etc.)
4. Approve the connection

<Tip>
Make sure you're on the Cronos network. The site will prompt you to switch if needed.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Claim Your Soldiers (1 minute)

Every new player gets **3 free soldiers** to start.

1. Click **Claim Soldiers** in the Command Center
2. Enter your email (for notifications)
3. Confirm the transaction (small gas fee)
4. Wait for minting to complete

You'll also receive **10 free Credits** as a welcome bonus.

<Note>
Claiming is one-time per wallet. Choose wisely — these are your founding troops.
</Note>

## Step 3: Meet Your Army (1 minute)

Go to the **Soldiers** page to see your new troops. Each soldier has:

- **Name** — Auto-generated, can be changed later
- **Rarity** — Common to Legendary (affects base stats)
- **Personality** — Determines special abilities in battle
- **Energy** — Required for battles and training (starts at 100%)

Click on any soldier to see their full stats.

## Step 4: Your First Training (2 minutes)

Let's level up a soldier:

1. Go to **Soldiers** page
2. Select a soldier
3. Click **Train**
4. Choose **Active Training**
5. Play the shooting drill (60 seconds)
6. Collect your XP!

<Tip>
Aim for 85%+ accuracy to get "Marksman" grade and maximum XP.
