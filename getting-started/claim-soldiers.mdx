# Claim Your Free Soldiers

The hardest part of Web3 gaming shouldn't be getting started. So we removed it.

**No wallet? No crypto? No problem.**

You can claim your free starter soldiers with just an email address.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Your Email">
    Visit [cronosarmy.com](https://cronosarmy.com) and enter your email address. That's it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Soldiers Reserved">
    3 soldiers are immediately reserved just for you. You'll see exactly which soldiers you're getting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Your Email">
    You'll receive a confirmation email showing your reserved soldiers with a claim link.
  </Step>
  <Step title="48 Hours to Claim">
    Your soldiers are held for 48 hours while you set up your wallet. No rush.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You Get

Every new commander receives:

- **3 Starter Soldiers** — Ready for battle with unique personalities

## Why Email First?

We believe Web3 gaming should be accessible to everyone — not just crypto natives.
