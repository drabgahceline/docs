## Choosing Your Chain

### Choose Cronos If:

- You're already in the Cronos ecosystem
- You want deeper CA liquidity
- You prefer the original player community
- You hold CRO or use Crypto.com

### Choose BNB Chain If:

- You're already in the BNB ecosystem
- You have BNB ready to go
- You want lower gas fees
- You prefer the larger DEX ecosystem

## Cross-Chain Considerations

### Soldiers Are Chain-Specific

Your soldiers are NFTs on a specific chain:
- Cronos soldiers exist on Cronos
- BNB soldiers exist on BNB Chain
- They cannot be transferred between chains

### Progress Is Chain-Specific

Your gameplay progress (territories, facilities, DP) is tied to your wallet on each chain. Playing on both chains means managing two separate accounts.

### CA Token Is Bridgeable

The CA token can be bridged between chains using supported bridges. This allows you to move CA liquidity between chains if needed.

<Note>
If you want to switch chains mid-game, you'll need to start fresh on the new chain. Consider this before choosing.
