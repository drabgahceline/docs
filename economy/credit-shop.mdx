# Credit Shop

Credits are the convenience currency in Cronos Army. Buy them with CRO to speed up gameplay. Everything is achievable without credits — they just save time.

## Credit Bundles

Purchase credits directly with CRO. Larger bundles give better value.

| Bundle | Credits | Price (CRO) | Per Credit |
|--------|---------|-------------|------------|
| Starter | 5 | 5 CRO | 1.00 CRO |
| Value | 10 | 9 CRO | 0.90 CRO |
| Popular | 20 | 15 CRO | 0.75 CRO |
| **Best Deal** | 50 | 35 CRO | 0.70 CRO |

<Tip>
The 50 credit bundle gives you the best value — 30% savings per credit compared to the Starter bundle.

## What Credits Buy

### Training

Each soldier can train up to **6 times per day** (1 free + 5 paid).

| Action | Cost |
|--------|------|
| First daily training | **FREE** |
| Additional training (2-6) | 1 credit each |
| Max trainings per day | 6 per soldier |

**Example:** Training a soldier 6 times in one day costs 5 credits (first free + 5 paid).

<Tip>
Training gives XP and a chance at gear drops. Active trainers level faster than passive players.
</Tip>

### Training Speed-Up

Skip the wait on passive (overnight) training.

| Action | Cost |
|--------|------|
| Instant complete passive training | 1 credit |

<Note>
Instant complete is a flat 1 credit regardless of time remaining. Use it when you need soldiers ready NOW.
</Note>

### Energy Recovery

Restore soldier energy instantly instead of waiting for natural regen.

| Action | Cost |
|--------|------|
| Energy recovery | 0.05 credits per 1% |
| Full recharge (0→100%) | 5 credits max |

**Example:** Restore 50% energy = 2.5 credits

### Facility Upgrades

Speed up territory facility construction.

| Action | Cost |
|--------|------|
| Instant facility build | 2 credits |
| Skip upgrade time | 1 credit per hour |

**Example:** A 24-hour upgrade costs 24 credits to instant-complete.

<Warning>
After instant-completing a facility upgrade, that facility has a **24-hour cooldown** before you can instant-complete again. Plan across multiple facilities.
</Warning>
