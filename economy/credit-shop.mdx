## What Credits Buy

### Training

Each soldier can train up to **6 times per day** (1 free + 5 paid).

| Action | Cost |
|--------|------|
| First daily training | **FREE** |
| Additional training (2-6) | 1 credit each |
| Max trainings per day | 6 per soldier |

**Example:** Training a soldier 6 times in one day costs 5 credits (first free + 5 paid).

<Tip>
Training gives XP and a chance at gear drops. Active trainers level faster than passive players.
