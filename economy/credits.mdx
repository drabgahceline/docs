## Using Credits Wisely

Credits are for convenience, not requirement. Everything can be done without credits — it just takes longer.

**Good times to use credits:**
- Critical territory defense incoming
- Tournament or event participation
- You want to play more, faster

**Save credits when:**
- Normal gameplay — let energy regenerate naturally
- No urgent battles
- Learning the game
