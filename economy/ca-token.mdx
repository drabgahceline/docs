<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction Burns">
    A percentage of marketplace and trading fees are burned permanently.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Feature Burns">
    Certain premium features require CA that gets burned on use.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Event Burns">
    Special events and tournaments burn participation fees.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
All burns are verifiable on-chain. The total supply decreases over time as the game economy grows.

## Economic Role

CA creates a sustainable game economy:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Players Earn CRO">
    Through territories and WPP rewards, players earn real CRO.
  </Step>
  <Step title="CRO Buys CA">
    Players use earned CRO to acquire CA for utility.
  </Step>
  <Step title="CA Powers Features">
    CA unlocks premium features and competitive advantages.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Burns Create Scarcity">
    Usage burns CA, making remaining supply more valuable.

## CA vs Credits

| Aspect | CA Token | Credits |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Type** | On-chain token | In-game currency |
| **Ownership** | Your wallet | Game account |
| **Transfer** | Wallet to wallet | Non-transferable |
| **Use** | Premium features, staking, trading | Convenience actions |
| **Value** | Market-determined | Fixed CRO price |

Both have their place. Credits are for quick convenience. CA is for serious competitive play and value storage.
