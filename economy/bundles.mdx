# Credit Bundles

Credits are the premium currency in Cronos Army. Use them to instantly complete facility upgrades and speed up other time-gated actions.

## What Are Credits?

Credits let you skip waiting times in the game. Primary uses:

| Use Case | Credits Required |
|----------|------------------|
| Instant facility build | 2 Credits |
| Skip upgrade time | 1 Credit per hour |
| Speed up training | 1 Credit per hour |

<Note>
Credits are **optional**. Everything in the game can be earned through normal gameplay — Credits just speed things up.
</Note>

## Purchasing Credits

Credits are purchased with CRO. Larger bundles offer better value.

## Credit Efficiency

### Upgrade Cost Examples

| Upgrade | Time | Credit Cost |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Level 1→2 | 2.8 hours | 3 Credits |
| Level 5→6 | 14.7 hours | 15 Credits |
| Level 10→11 | 31.6 hours | 32 Credits |
| Level 15→16 | 58.1 hours | 59 Credits |
| Level 20→21 | 89.4 hours | 90 Credits |

**Formula:** Credits = ⌈hours⌉ (rounded up)

### Value Analysis

At higher levels, Credits become more efficient:

| Level Range | Hours per Credit |
|-------------|------------------|
| 1-5 | ~0.9 hours |
| 6-10 | ~0.95 hours |
| 11-20 | ~1.0 hours |
| 20+ | ~1.0 hours |

<Tip>
Save Credits for Level 10+ upgrades where you get maximum time-skip value per Credit.

Plan your Credit usage across multiple facilities to avoid hitting cooldowns.
