# Staking

Stake CA tokens to strengthen your territory defenses. Staking is a two-step process: first stake your CA, then assign it to territories.

## How Staking Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stake CA Tokens">
    Deposit CA tokens into the staking contract (global pool)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign to Territories">
    Allocate your staked CA to specific territories you own
  </Step>
  <Step title="Defend & Earn">
    Higher stake = stronger defense. Territory owners earn CRO daily.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim Rewards">
    Earnings are calculated daily. Withdraw anytime.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Two Interfaces

Staking uses two separate UIs:

| Interface | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Staking Panel** | Stake/unstake CA tokens globally |
| **Territory Manager** | Assign staked CA to your territories |

You must stake first, then allocate. Unallocated staked CA provides no benefit.

## Stake Requirements by Territory

Each territory type has a minimum stake requirement:

| Territory Type | Min Stake | 2x Defense | 3x Defense | 4x Defense |
|---------------|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Common** | Varies | 2× min | 3× min | 4× min |
| **Rare** | Varies | 2× min | 3× min | 4× min |
| **Epic** | Varies | 2× min | 3× min | 4× min |

<Note>
Each territory has its own stake requirement shown in the Territory Manager. Requirements scale with territory value.
</Note>

## Defense Multipliers

Higher stake = stronger defense in battles:

| Stake Level | Defense Bonus |
|-------------|---------------|
| 1× (minimum) | No bonus |
| 2× | +10% defense |
| 3× | +20% defense |
| 4× (max) | +35% defense |

<Warning>
Staking more CA does **not** increase your CRO earnings. It only increases your defense strength.
</Warning>

## Earning CRO

Territory owners earn CRO passively based on:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Territory type** | Epic > Rare > Common |
| **Base reward** | Set per territory |
| **Ownership** | You must control the territory |

<Info>
Rewards are calculated and assigned **once per day**. You can claim them anytime from your rewards panel.
</Info>

### Reward Rates (per hour)

| Territory Type | Base Reward |
|---------------|-------------|
| Common | ~0.065 CRO |
| Rare | ~0.21 CRO |
| Epic | ~1.49 CRO |

## Staking & Unstaking

### To Stake
1. Go to **Staking Panel**
2. Enter amount of CA to stake
3. Confirm transaction
4. Then go to **Territory Manager** to allocate

### To Unstake
1. Go to **Staking Panel**
2. Enter amount to unstake
3. Confirm transaction
4. Tokens return to your wallet

<Tip>
**No cooldown period.** You can unstake anytime. However, unstaking removes your territory allocations and those territories will stop earning.
</Tip>

## What Happens If You Lose a Territory?

If an attacker captures your territory:
- Your staked CA remains yours (stays in staking contract)
- That territory **stops earning** for you
- You don't lose any accumulated rewards
- You can reallocate your stake to other territories

<Note>
You never lose staked CA or accumulated rewards. Losing a territory just means you stop earning from it until you reclaim or capture another.

  <Card title="Match Stake to Value" icon="scale-balanced">
    Put more stake on valuable territories worth defending.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Defense vs Earnings" icon="shield">
    Higher stake = better defense, not more earnings. Stake to deter attackers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keep Some Liquid" icon="water">
    Don't stake everything. Keep CA liquid for new territory opportunities.

  <Card title="Claim Regularly" icon="hand-holding-dollar">
    Rewards don't auto-compound. Claim and reinvest manually if desired.
