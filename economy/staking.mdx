## Staking Mechanics

### Stake Calculation

Your hourly CRO earnings depend on:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **CA Staked** | More stake = more earnings |
| **Territory Value** | Strategic locations earn more |
| **Total Pool** | Your share of global rewards |

### Minimum Stakes

| Territory Tier | Minimum Stake |
|---------------|---------------|
| Tier 1 | 10,000 CA |
| Tier 2 | 25,000 CA |
| Tier 3 | 50,000 CA |
| Tier 4 | 100,000 CA |
| Tier 5 | 200,000 CA |

<Note>
Higher tier territories can hold more stake and generate proportionally more income.
</Note>

## How to Stake

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Territory">
    Select a territory you own from the Command Center
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Stake">
    Open the staking panel for that territory

## Managing Your Stake

### Adding More Stake

You can add to your stake at any time:

To unstake CA tokens:

1. Select the territory
2. Click "Unstake"

### Stake Distribution

| **Concentrated** | High-value territories you can defend |
| **Distributed** | Lower risk, lower individual returns |
| **Tiered** | Most stake on best territories, some on backup |

## Staking vs. Holding

| Factor | Staked CA | Unstaked CA |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Earning CRO | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Liquidity | 72h cooldown | Immediate |
| Risk | Territory loss | None |
| Growth | Compound earnings | Price only |

<Tip>
Stake CA you don't need short-term. Keep some liquid for opportunities like new territory mints or market purchases.
