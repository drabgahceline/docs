# Earning Rewards

Cronos Army rewards active players with real CRO. Here's how.

## Two Income Streams

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Territory Income" icon="map">
    **Passive earnings.** Hold territories to generate CRO every hour.
  </Card>
  <Card title="WPP Rewards" icon="trophy">
    **Weekly payouts.** Battle for WPP, claim rewards every Sunday.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Territory Income

Every territory you control generates CRO passively:

- **Hourly accumulation** — CRO adds up while you hold the territory
- **Different values** — Strategic territories earn more
- **Stack territories** — More holdings = more income
- **Defend to keep** — Lose the territory, lose the income

### Claiming Income

Your accumulated CRO can be claimed anytime. It transfers directly to your connected wallet — no lockups, no waiting periods.

## WPP Weekly Rewards

At the end of each week:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Leaderboard Finalizes">
    All players ranked by total WPP earned that week.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pool Distributes">
    Reward pool split according to rankings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="CRO Sent">
    Rewards delivered to your wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reset">
    WPP goes to zero. New week begins.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Where Does the Pool Come From?

The weekly reward pool is funded by:
- Game revenue
- Territory transaction fees
- Credit purchases

The more active the game economy, the bigger the weekly pool.
