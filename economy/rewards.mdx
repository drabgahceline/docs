# Earning Rewards

Cronos Army rewards active players with real CRO.

## Income Streams

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Territory Income

Every territory generates CRO while you control it:

- Income accrues **every hour**
- Different territories have different values
- You can hold **multiple territories**
- **Defend or lose** — undefended territories get captured

### Claiming Territory Income

Your accumulated CRO can be claimed anytime. It goes directly to your connected wallet.

## WPP Weekly Rewards

At the end of each week:

1. Total WPP leaderboard is calculated
2. Reward pool is distributed by ranking
3. CRO sent to your wallet
4. WPP resets for new week

### Reward Pool

The weekly pool comes from:
- Game revenue
- Territory fees
- Credit purchases

The more active the game, the bigger the pool.

## Maximizing Earnings

<Tip>
  **Play regularly.** Daily players earn more than occasional bursts.
</Tip>

1. **Hold valuable territories** — Check the map for high-income spots
2. **Defend your holdings** — Lost territory = lost income
3. **Battle for WPP** — Even losing earns points
4. **Stay active** — Consistent play compounds rewards

## Withdrawing

Your earned CRO is yours. Withdraw anytime to your wallet with no lockups or fees (beyond gas).
