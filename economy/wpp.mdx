# War Participation Points

WPP measures your weekly activity. More WPP = bigger share of weekly rewards.

## Earning WPP

| Action | WPP Earned |
|--------|------------|
| Enter a battle | +5 |
| Win a battle | +20 bonus |
| Capture territory | +10 bonus |
| Defend territory | +10 bonus |

**Example:** Win an attacking battle = 5 (participation) + 20 (win) + 10 (capture) = **35 WPP**

## Weekly Cycle

  </Step>
  <Step title="Week Ends Sunday">
    The reward pool is distributed based on rankings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reset & Repeat">
    WPP resets to zero. New week, new opportunity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Reward Distribution

The weekly reward pool is distributed proportionally based on WPP:

- **Top 10** — Largest individual shares
- **Top 100** — Solid rewards
- **Everyone else** — Smaller but still meaningful shares

<Tip>
  You don't have to win every battle. Consistent participation beats occasional dominance.
</Tip>

## Strategy

**For maximum WPP:**
1. Battle daily, even just a few fights
2. Focus on winning (double points)
3. Attack territories (capture bonus)
4. Defend your holdings (defense bonus)

The most active players earn the most. Simple as that.
