# War Participation Points (WPP)

WPP tracks your weekly battle activity. More WPP = bigger share of weekly rewards.

## Earning WPP

| Action | WPP Earned |
|--------|------------|
| Enter any battle | +5 |
| Win the battle | +20 bonus |
| Capture territory | +10 bonus |
| Defend territory | +10 bonus |

**Example Scenarios:**

- Lose an attack: **5 WPP** (participation only)
- Win an attack: **35 WPP** (5 + 20 win + 10 capture)
- Win a defense: **35 WPP** (5 + 20 win + 10 defend)

## The Weekly Cycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Battle All Week">
    Every fight earns WPP. Win or lose, you're accumulating points.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Climb the Leaderboard">
    Your total WPP determines your ranking among all players.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Week Ends Sunday">
    The reward pool is distributed based on final rankings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reset">
    WPP resets to zero. New week, fresh competition.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Reward Distribution

The weekly reward pool is split based on WPP rankings:

| Rank | Reward Share |
|------|--------------|
| **Top 10** | Largest individual payouts |
| **Top 100** | Solid rewards |
| **All Participants** | Proportional share based on WPP |

<Note>
You don't need to be #1 to earn. Everyone who participates gets something proportional to their activity.

## Maximizing WPP

    Consistent daily battles beat occasional grinding sessions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Win More" icon="trophy">
    Victories give 4x more WPP than losses (25 vs 5).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hold Territories" icon="map">
    Territory capture/defense adds +10 WPP per battle.

<Tip>
Even if you can't win every fight, just participating keeps you earning. 10 losses = 50 WPP. Better than zero.
