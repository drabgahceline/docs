## Day 5: Consider a Base

### Should You Mint a Base?

Bases unlock facility bonuses that help your soldiers grow faster. Consider minting if:

- ✅ You have 3+ soldiers
- ✅ You're earning consistent DP from PvP
- ✅ You want to progress faster
- ✅ You have 100,000 CA tokens

### What Bases Provide

| Facility | Bonus |
|----------|-------|
| Hospital | Faster energy recovery |
| Barracks | More training XP |
| Forge | Better gear drop rates |
| Comms Center | More DP from PvP |

<Note>
Bases are optional. You can play effectively without one while you learn. Mint when ready.
</Note>

**Day 5 Goal:** Complete daily checks. Evaluate whether to mint a base.

## Day 6: Optimize Your Routine

### Daily Routine Template

| Time | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Morning** | Collect overnight deploy rewards | DP |
| **Morning** | Start 24h training | WPP + XP |
| **Midday** | Complete discipline checks | CDP |
| **Evening** | PvP attack session | DP + WPP |
| **Night** | 8h deployment | Passive DP |

### Energy Rotation

If you have 3 soldiers:

- **Soldier A:** Deploy overnight (8h)

Rotate daily so everyone gets rest.

**Day 6 Goal:** Establish a daily routine. Complete all checks.
