# Earning CRO

Cronos Army offers multiple ways to earn real value. From passive territory income to competitive weekly rewards, here's your complete guide to earning CRO.

## Earning Methods Overview

| Method | Type | Frequency | Skill Required |
|--------|------|-----------|----------------|
| Territory Income | Passive | Hourly | Low |
| WPP Leaderboard | Competitive | Weekly | Medium |
| Referral Rewards | Passive | Weekly | Low |
| Conquest Leaderboard | Competitive | Monthly | High |

## Territory Income

Control territories to earn passive CRO every hour.

### How It Works

1. **Capture territories** through conquest battles
2. **Stake CA tokens** on your territory
3. **Earn hourly CRO** based on territory value and stake

### Territory Values

Different territories generate different income:
- **Strategic locations** near the center earn more
- **High-value territories** attract more attacks
- **Multiple territories** = compounding income

<Tip>
Balance expansion with defense. Holding 3 territories you can defend beats holding 10 you can't.
</Tip>
