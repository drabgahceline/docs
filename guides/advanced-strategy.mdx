# Advanced Strategy

Master these advanced techniques to dominate the battlefield, optimize your earnings, and outmaneuver other commanders.

## Army Composition

### The Optimal Army Size

| Army Size | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|------|------|
| 3-5 soldiers | Easy management, focused upgrades | Limited rotation options |
| 6-10 soldiers | Good rotation, balanced coverage | Moderate investment |
| 15-20 soldiers | Full flexibility, multi-territory | Requires significant time |
| 20+ soldiers | Maximum coverage | Diminishing returns |

<Tip>
**Sweet spot: 8-12 soldiers.** Enough for 3-soldier territory garrison, 3-4 PvP rotation, and 2-3 training at once.
</Tip>

### Strategic Soldier Rotation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Territory Defense (3 soldiers)">
    Your strongest soldiers hold the territory. They benefit from facility bonuses and auto-defend.
  </Step>
  <Step title="PvP Squad (4 soldiers)">
    Second-tier soldiers actively battle. Deploy overnight, attack during the day.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Training Squad (3 soldiers)">
    Weakest or recovering soldiers train continuously. They gain XP and gear while others battle.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Weekly rotation:** Swap soldiers between squads based on energy levels and power growth.

## Energy Optimization

### The Energy Efficiency Table

| Energy Level | Best Action | Reason |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| 90-100% | PvP Attack | Maximum win rate |
| 70-89% | PvP Deploy | Still strong, guaranteed DP |
| 50-69% | PvP Deploy (short) | Play safe, 2h deployments |
| 30-49% | Training | Recover while gaining XP |
| 0-29% | Rest | Don't waste training energy |

### Maximizing Battles Per Day

With Hospital Level 10 (+26.7% recovery):
- Base recovery: 10 energy/hour → 12.67 energy/hour
- Full recovery (0→100): ~8 hours instead of 10

<Note>
Hospital upgrades compound over time. A Level 20 Hospital recovers 14 energy/hour — that's 40% faster than base.
</Note>

## Facility Strategy

### Diminishing Returns Insight

All facilities use asymptotic bonuses, meaning:
- Level 1→10: Large improvements
- Level 10→20: Moderate improvements
- Level 20→30: Small improvements

**Implication:** Keep all facilities balanced. Four Level 10 facilities beat one Level 30 and three Level 5.

### Upgrade Priority by Playstyle

| Playstyle | Priority 1 | Priority 2 | Priority 3 | Priority 4 |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Grinder (4+ hrs/day)** | Hospital | Comms | Barracks | Forge |
| **Casual (1-2 hrs/day)** | Barracks | Forge | Comms | Hospital |
| **PvP Focus** | Comms | Hospital | Barracks | Forge |
| **Collector** | Forge | Barracks | Hospital | Comms |

## Territory Control

### Attack Timing

| Time | Advantage |
|------|-----------|
| **After server reset (00:05 UTC)** | Opponents may have weak garrisons after weekly activities |
| **Weekday mornings (06:00-09:00 UTC)** | Many players asleep, can't respond to sieges |
| **Friday evening** | Players may be distracted, end-of-week fatigue |

### Defense Positioning

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cluster Territories" icon="users">
    Own adjacent territories. Attackers can only approach from limited directions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Decoy Strategy" icon="mask">
    Garrison one territory heavily. Leave others lighter. Attackers waste energy on the strong one.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Reclamation Speed

Lost a territory? Attack immediately (no cooldown for reclamation). Your opponent's garrison is likely weakened from their attack.

## WPP Maximization

### High-WPP Actions

| Action | WPP | Time Investment | Efficiency |
|--------|-----|-----------------|------------|
| 24h Training | 24 | Set and forget | ★★★★★ |
| Territory Conquest | 25 | Variable | ★★★★ |
| Facility Build | 15 | 2 DP + 2 hours | ★★★★ |
| Facility Upgrade | 10×level | DP + time | ★★★ |
| PvP Attack Win | 15 | ~5 minutes | ★★★ |
| PvP Deploy (8h) | 8 | Set and forget | ★★ |

### Weekly WPP Strategy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Days 1-2: Qualify">
    Complete 4 discipline checks to ensure leaderboard eligibility.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Days 3-5: Build">
    Run 24h training sessions, facility upgrades, territory attacks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Days 6-7: Push">
    Maximum PvP activity, conquest attempts, final facility upgrades.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Resource Efficiency

### DP Spending Priority

| Investment | ROI | Notes |
|------------|-----|-------|
| Facility upgrades | ★★★★★ | Compound forever |
| Territory development | ★★★★ | Enables merging |
| Training duration | ★★★ | Time-limited value |

### Credit Usage

<Warning>
Credits should be reserved for high-value situations. Don't waste them on short waits.
</Warning>

**Worth it:**
- Upgrades over 24 hours
- Final push before merge requirement
- Event deadlines

**Not worth it:**
- Upgrades under 6 hours
- Non-critical facilities
- "Convenience" skips

## Multi-Territory Management

### Territory Capacity Planning

| Soldiers | Max Territories | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| 6 | 2 | Tight, minimal rotation |
| 10 | 3 | Comfortable |
| 15 | 4-5 | Flexible |
| 20 | 6-7 | Maximum expansion |

**Rule of thumb:** 3 soldiers per territory minimum, plus 2-3 spare for PvP rotation.

### Merge Planning

Before merging:
1. Max out both territories to 50+ facility levels
2. Clear any active upgrades
3. Decide which soldiers to reassign
4. Have a plan for the new higher-tier base

<Tip>
Facility levels average when merging. Push both bases equally — uneven merges waste progress.
</Tip>

## Leaderboard Strategy

### Weekly Competition

| Rank Target | Strategy | Time Required |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Top 5 | Maximum activity, daily discipline, conquest push | 3+ hrs/day |
| Top 25 | Consistent daily play, training + some PvP | 1-2 hrs/day |
| Top 100 | Complete discipline checks, basic training | 30 min/day |

### Conquest Leaderboard (Monthly)

- Save conquest attacks for the final week
- Identify weak opponents early, track their activity
- Coordinate timing to maximize captures in burst

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Over-investing in one soldier">
    Spread XP and gear across your army. One super-soldier can only be in one place.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ignoring facility balance">
    Four Level 10 facilities beat one Level 40. Diminishing returns matter.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Holding too many territories">
    Quality over quantity. 3 well-defended territories beat 8 you keep losing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Skipping daily checks">
    Leaderboard eligibility requires 4 checks per week. Miss it and you get no ranking.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Attacking with low energy">
    50% energy = 50% power. Wait for 80%+ or you're wasting opportunities.
