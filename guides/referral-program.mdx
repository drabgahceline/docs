# Referral Program

Grow the Cronos Army and earn rewards. Share your unique referral code with friends — when they mint soldiers using your code, you earn a share of the weekly reward pool.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your Code">
    Connect your wallet and visit your profile. Your unique 8-character referral code is generated automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share It">
    Post your code on social media, Discord, gaming communities, or send it directly to friends.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track Mints">
    When someone uses your code to mint soldiers, their mint revenue is credited to your weekly stats.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Earn Rewards">
    Top 5 referrers each week split the reward pool based on their ranking.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Weekly Reward Pool

The reward pool consists of:
- **Base pool:** $20 USD
- **Bonus:** 10% of all referred mint revenue (in USD)

<Note>
Only the **top 5 referrers** each week receive rewards. Rankings are based on total referred mint revenue converted to USD.
</Note>

### Reward Distribution

| Rank | Share | Example ($50 pool) |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| #1 | 40% | $20 |
| #2 | 25% | $12.50 |
| #3 | 15% | $7.50 |
| #4 | 10% | $5 |
| #5 | 10% | $5 |

## Tracking Your Referrals

Your referral dashboard shows:

| Metric | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Total Referrals** | Unique wallets that used your code |
| **Total Soldiers** | Number of soldiers minted with your code |
| **Weekly Rank** | Your current position on the leaderboard |
| **Estimated Reward** | Your share of this week's pool (if top 5) |
